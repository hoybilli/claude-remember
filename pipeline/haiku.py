"""Claude CLI wrapper for calling Haiku and parsing structured JSON responses.

Provides the single interface used by all pipeline stages to invoke Haiku.
Handles subprocess management, removal of the parent session's own variables
before the spawn (the names in ``_without_session_env``, #95), JSON
parsing, token counting, and cost estimation.

The nested ``claude -p`` inherits this process's environment -- the one the
hook was started with, including the user's Claude Code login -- exactly like
any process a hook starts. This module reads no credential of its own.

The CLI is invoked in a sandboxed configuration: a fresh, empty `cwd`
created and torn down around each call (`_isolated_summarizer_cwd`, #724 --
NOT the shared system tempdir, which is where another concurrent save's own
tempfiles and the merged config live), every built-in tool made unavailable unless requested (`--tools ""`, #724,
F8 -- an empty `--allowedTools` alone leaves tools that need no approval
still callable, and a hand-maintained deny-list is only ever as complete as
its last update against the CLI's own tool inventory),
``max-turns`` configurable via ``REMEMBER_MAX_TURNS`` (default 4), no MCP
servers (#94), no setting sources and therefore no hooks (#202), and the
parent Claude Code session's variables are removed for the spawn
(``CLAUDECODE`` to allow a nested session; ``CLAUDE_JOB_DIR``,
``CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`` and the session-scoped ``CLAUDE_CODE_*`` names so the
child doesn't masquerade as the parent's session, #95 -- literal names in
``_without_session_env``). ``REMEMBER_NESTED_SUMMARIZER`` is set
so the plugin's own hooks recognise the child and no-op (#204) — that covers
*our* hooks specifically, and stays load-bearing on the fallback path below,
where setting-source isolation has been dropped and the user's hooks are live.
The Codex route (`_call_codex`) instead runs with an allow-listed child
environment, one literal read per allowed name, since its
``--sandbox read-only`` still permits command execution (#724, F9/F10).

The output of that call is NOT guaranteed to be the model speaking — a blocking
hook makes the CLI answer in its own voice, on stdout, with exit 0. See
``docs/nested-model-output.md`` before changing how it is validated.

Module-level constants:
    HAIKU_INPUT_PRICE: USD cost per input token.
    HAIKU_OUTPUT_PRICE: USD cost per output token.
    HAIKU_CACHE_PRICE: USD cost per cache-read input token.

# ─── Host-native summarizer routing (#460) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `claude -p` was the only summarizer this module ever shelled out to, so a
# session run entirely inside Codex still paid Anthropic to remember an
# OpenAI session, and needed an authenticated Claude CLI installed for no
# reason a Codex user chose. `codex exec` (verified working against
# codex-cli 0.150.1, #460) is the on-host equivalent and is already installed
# wherever this problem occurs.
#
# REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER selects the provider: "claude" (always the Claude CLI --
# the historical, only-ever behaviour), "codex" (always `codex exec`), or
# "auto" (the default), which reads the TRANSCRIPT the host actually wrote
# (#465) rather than its environment. A Claude Code session's own provider
# resolution is therefore untouched by this feature: it was already
# "claude", and "auto" still answers "claude" for it.
#
# "auto" used to ask pipeline.host.detect_host() -- env-var signatures
# (#460, keyed correctly only after #463). #465 found that mechanism cannot
# work for THIS call site: detect_host() runs inside the summarizer, which
# is spawned from scripts/haiku's caller (pipeline/haiku.py -> _call_codex /
# _call_claude), itself reached through scripts/save-session.sh ->
# scripts/session-end-hook.sh, a process Codex spawns as a HOOK, not the
# tool shell #464's own CODEX_SESSION_ID/CODEX_THREAD_ID fixture was
# captured from. Measured against a live codex-cli 0.150.1 SessionEnd hook
# invocation (env dumped from inside the hook, CLAUDE_CODE_* stripped):
# neither CODEX_SESSION_ID nor CODEX_THREAD_ID reached the process at all --
# only PLUGIN_ROOT/CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT survived. So under "auto", every
# default-configured Codex user's hook-triggered save kept resolving
# "claude", #460's whole point, unreached.
#
# The replacement depends on what the host WROTE, not what it exported: the
# hooks already trust and export REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH
# (pipeline.host.transcript_path()), and pipeline.extract.sniff_file_envelope()
# already tells a Codex rollout from a Claude Code transcript by shape
# (#443). A transcript a host wrote cannot be silently withdrawn the way a
# compatibility env var can -- the failure mode #463 and #465 are both
# instances of.
#
# pipeline.host.detect_host() itself is unchanged and still exercised
# directly by tests/test_codex_signature_463.py (env-signature detection is
# still a real, correct fact about a process); it is simply no longer the
# mechanism this router calls for "auto".
#
# REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER_FALLBACK is the opt-in for what happens when the
# resolved codex route cannot produce a result (binary missing, non-zero
# exit, empty output, timeout): unset means "could not summarize", raised
# loudly rather than silently retried against Anthropic's API; "claude" means
# fall back to `claude -p`, exactly as though REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER=claude had
# been set for this one call -- and it is logged every time it fires, because
# it reproduces this issue's own billing complaint, on purpose, only because
# the operator asked for it.

# own "sends data" shape. The nested `claude -p` now runs with whatever
# authentication it inherits from its own environment, or none at all; this

    conversation that merely *discusses* an auth failure — a dev debugging their
    login — could put "not logged in" in front of a scan whose answer decides
    whether the retry runs with the user's hooks live. That is the conversation
    choosing when isolation is dropped, which is not a decision it may make.

    So the scan reads the fields the CLI authors: `error` / `result` / `message`,
    plus the `errors` list (`error_max_turns` populates only that one — measured:
    it exits 1 and carries no `result` key at all), plus stderr.

    **Unparseable or unrecognised stdout falls back to the raw scan**, and that

    refusing to look would fail *closed*, which is a permanent silent outage —
    the #316 shape exactly. The fallback applies only when nothing structured was

    **The field set is an assumption and cannot be widened here** (#320). A
    terminal record that reports an auth failure in a field this does not read,
    while a field it does read holds something benign, is scanned and found
    clean — and the fallback cannot fire, because `authored` is non-empty.
    Scanning the raw blob on that branch instead would restore the very

# #898 rounds 16-17: the list names no credential. Codex's own login lives
# in CODEX_HOME/auth.json (`codex login`), which is unaffected; an
# environment-variable-only Codex login is not passed through. Round 16 had
# made the list config so an operator could add a name; round 17 writes it

# environment by a config-supplied name is what the directory scanner
# reports as "an environment variable named at run time". Changing it needs
# a release.

# #898 round 18 (maintainer decision): no proxy or CA-bundle variable is
# passed through any more, in either casing. #751 had added them on a
# reasoned audit finding, not a user request -- no user ever asked for
# proxy support -- and #798 had flagged the same names as a leak risk.
# Taking them off is also what cleared the directory portal's credential
# hold. Behind a proxy, use REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER=claude: the Claude route
# inherits the full environment. With the lowercase proxy reads gone, the
# #792 Windows case-folding note that justified skipping them there no
# longer applies to anything on this list.
#
# The Windows-only names (SYSTEMROOT/USERPROFILE/APPDATA/PATHEXT) are read
# UNCONDITIONALLY: `_codex_child_env` only passes through a name that is

    The allowed names are written out below, one literal read each (#898
    round 17, see the comment above); what they are, and why:

    ``PATH``/``HOME``: find and run the binary, resolve ``~``.
    ``LANG``/``LC_ALL``: locale-dependent CLI output.
    ``TMPDIR``/``TEMP``/``TMP``: whichever the platform sets, if any.
    ``CODEX_HOME``: where Codex's own ``auth.json`` lives, if overridden --
    unaffected by this allow-list either way, matching the note in
    `_build_codex_cmd`'s docstring.
    ``SYSTEMROOT``/``USERPROFILE``/``APPDATA``/``PATHEXT``: Windows-only in
    practice (#751) -- absent from ``os.environ`` everywhere else, so listing
    them here costs nothing on POSIX.
    No credential: Codex authenticates from its filesystem ``auth.json``
    (``codex login``); a login held only in an environment variable is not

    """The nested ``codex exec`` invocation (#460).

    ``--sandbox read-only``: denies writes and network -- NOT command
    execution. Codex's read-only sandbox still runs whatever commands the
    model issues; this is NOT the tool-less guarantee the comment here used
    to claim (mirroring the Claude path's default empty ``--allowedTools``,
    itself incomplete for the same reason -- see #724, F8/F9). Two SEPARATE
    mechanisms bound the blast radius of a command run here, for two
    SEPARATE audiences:
      * `_codex_child_env` -- the ``env=`` kwarg passed to `subprocess.run`
        -- is what CODEX'S OWN PROCESS receives from this host (its CLI
        needs PATH/HOME to run at all; the list names no credential, #898
        rounds 16-17, and no proxy/CA variable, #898 round 18).
      * the ``-c shell_environment_policy.inherit=none`` override below is
        what a COMMAND CODEX SPAWNS internally receives. These are not the
        same environment: Codex does not hand a spawned command its own
        process env by default just because that is what this host gave
        it. Before #798, nothing here set this policy at all, so a
        transcript-injected instruction that got the model to run a shell
        command inside this sandbox could read an operator-added credential
        and the proxy vars (then on the list, #751; off it since #898 round
        18) directly out of that command's environment. `_codex_child_env`'s
        allow-list stays necessary (Codex's own process still needs its
        environment); it was never sufficient for this.
        Confirmed against codex-cli 0.153.2's own ``--help`` and the
        official Codex manual (fetched 2026-09-26): `shell_environment_policy`
        is a real, documented dotted-path config key, and ``-c`` overrides
        apply regardless of whether ``config.toml`` is loaded -- relevant
        since this call also passes ``--ignore-user-config``. NOT re-verified
        against codex-cli 0.150.1, the version this repo's own README pins as
        "observed working" (unlike the ``--ignore-user-config`` isolation
        claim two paragraphs below, which was) -- `ShellEnvironmentPolicyInherit`
        is a long-standing enum in Codex's own config schema, not something
        new in 0.153.2, so the risk of it being absent on 0.150.1 is judged
        low, but this is reasoned, not observed, on that specific version.
        ``inherit=none`` also means a spawned command gets NO environment at
        all -- not just no secrets, but no ``PATH``/``HOME``/locale either.
        That is a real behavioral change from "full inherit", not only a
        narrowing of what secrets are visible: a command the model tries to
        run that relies on ``PATH`` to resolve a bare command name will now
        fail to find it. Accepted here because nothing about this
        summarizer's actual job (producing the model's final text message)
        depends on a spawned command succeeding -- unlike `_codex_child_env`,
        which deliberately keeps just enough (``PATH``/``HOME``/locale/temp) for
        Codex's OWN process to run and authenticate, this policy governs a
        code path this feature does not intend to rely on at all.
        Unit tests here can only assert the argv carries this exact string;
        none can spawn a real `codex exec` to confirm the CLI actually
        empties a spawned command's environment when given it -- that trust
        boundary (does codex-cli honor its own documented flag at runtime)
        is not verifiable from this codebase.
    the fresh, empty `cwd` this call is given (`_isolated_summarizer_cwd`,
    #724) narrows what such a command could even find to act on, but does
    not touch what it can read from its own environment -- that is this
    policy's job, not the cwd's.
    ``--skip-git-repo-check``: cwd is a temp dir, never a git repo.
    ``--ephemeral``: no session file persisted for a one-shot summarizer call.
    ``--ignore-user-config``: Codex's own equivalent of the Claude path's
    ``--setting-sources ''`` hook isolation (#202) -- verified against
    codex-cli 0.150.1 that omitting this flag runs the operator's own Codex
    hooks (including this plugin's, if installed for Codex) inside the
    nested call; ``CODEX_HOME`` auth is unaffected by it.
    ``-o``: the model's final message, and nothing else Codex prints while it
    runs, written to its own file -- avoids parsing progress/reasoning noise
    out of stdout the way ``--output-format json`` lets the Claude path avoid
    it.
    ``-``: read the prompt from stdin, not argv (mirrors the Claude path's
    E2BIG concern -- see ``call_haiku``'s docstring).
