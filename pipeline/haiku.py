"""Claude CLI wrapper for calling Haiku and parsing structured JSON responses.

Provides the single interface used by all pipeline stages to invoke Haiku.
Handles subprocess management, parent-session env stripping (CLAUDECODE +
CLAUDE_JOB_DIR + CLAUDE_CODE_*), JSON parsing, token counting, and cost
estimation.

The CLI is invoked in a sandboxed configuration: a fresh, empty `cwd`
created and torn down around each call (`_isolated_summarizer_cwd`, #724 --
NOT the shared system tempdir, which is where another concurrent save's own
tempfiles and the merged config live), every built-in tool made unavailable unless requested (`--tools ""`, #724,
F8 -- an empty `--allowedTools` alone leaves tools that need no approval
still callable, and a hand-maintained deny-list is only ever as complete as
its last update against the CLI's own tool inventory),
``max-turns`` configurable via ``REMEMBER_MAX_TURNS`` (default 4), no MCP
servers (#94), no setting sources and therefore no hooks (#202), and the
parent Claude Code session env vars are stripped (``CLAUDECODE`` to allow a
nested session; ``CLAUDE_JOB_DIR`` / ``CLAUDE_CODE_*`` so the child doesn't
masquerade as the parent's session, #95). ``REMEMBER_NESTED_SUMMARIZER`` is set
so the plugin's own hooks recognise the child and no-op (#204) — that covers
*our* hooks specifically, and stays load-bearing on the fallback path below,
where setting-source isolation has been dropped and the user's hooks are live.
The Codex route (`_call_codex`) additionally runs with an allow-listed child
environment rather than the Claude route's deny-list one, since its
``--sandbox read-only`` still permits command execution (#724, F9/F10).

The output of that call is NOT guaranteed to be the model speaking — a blocking
hook makes the CLI answer in its own voice, on stdout, with exit 0. See
``docs/nested-model-output.md`` before changing how it is validated.

Module-level constants:
    HAIKU_INPUT_PRICE: USD cost per input token.
    HAIKU_OUTPUT_PRICE: USD cost per output token.
    HAIKU_CACHE_PRICE: USD cost per cache-read input token.

# ─── Host-native summarizer routing (#460) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `claude -p` was the only summarizer this module ever shelled out to, so a
# session run entirely inside Codex still paid Anthropic to remember an
# OpenAI session, and needed an authenticated Claude CLI installed for no
# reason a Codex user chose. `codex exec` (verified working against
# codex-cli 0.150.1, #460) is the on-host equivalent and is already installed
# wherever this problem occurs.
#
# REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER selects the provider: "claude" (always the Claude CLI --
# the historical, only-ever behaviour), "codex" (always `codex exec`), or
# "auto" (the default), which reads the TRANSCRIPT the host actually wrote
# (#465) rather than its environment. A Claude Code session's own provider
# resolution is therefore untouched by this feature: it was already
# "claude", and "auto" still answers "claude" for it.
#
# "auto" used to ask pipeline.host.detect_host() -- env-var signatures
# (#460, keyed correctly only after #463). #465 found that mechanism cannot
# work for THIS call site: detect_host() runs inside the summarizer, which
# is spawned from scripts/haiku's caller (pipeline/haiku.py -> _call_codex /
# _call_claude), itself reached through scripts/save-session.sh ->
# scripts/session-end-hook.sh, a process Codex spawns as a HOOK, not the
# tool shell #464's own CODEX_SESSION_ID/CODEX_THREAD_ID fixture was
# captured from. Measured against a live codex-cli 0.150.1 SessionEnd hook
# invocation (env dumped from inside the hook, CLAUDE_CODE_* stripped):
# neither CODEX_SESSION_ID nor CODEX_THREAD_ID reached the process at all --
# only PLUGIN_ROOT/CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT survived. So under "auto", every
# default-configured Codex user's hook-triggered save kept resolving
# "claude", #460's whole point, unreached.
#
# The replacement depends on what the host WROTE, not what it exported: the
# hooks already trust and export REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH
# (pipeline.host.transcript_path()), and pipeline.extract.sniff_file_envelope()
# already tells a Codex rollout from a Claude Code transcript by shape
# (#443). A transcript a host wrote cannot be silently withdrawn the way a
# compatibility env var can -- the failure mode #463 and #465 are both
# instances of.
#
# pipeline.host.detect_host() itself is unchanged and still exercised
# directly by tests/test_codex_signature_463.py (env-signature detection is
# still a real, correct fact about a process); it is simply no longer the
# mechanism this router calls for "auto".
#
# REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER_FALLBACK is the opt-in for what happens when the
# resolved codex route cannot produce a result (binary missing, non-zero
# exit, empty output, timeout): unset means "could not summarize", raised
# loudly rather than silently retried against Anthropic's API; "claude" means
# fall back to `claude -p`, exactly as though REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER=claude had
# been set for this one call -- and it is logged every time it fires, because
# it reproduces this issue's own billing complaint, on purpose, only because
# the operator asked for it.

    ``CLAUDECODE`` blocks nested sessions. ``CLAUDE_JOB_DIR`` and the
    ``CLAUDE_CODE_*`` family (e.g. ``CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID``) identify the
    parent Claude Code session; if they leak into the subprocess it looks like
    a resumable session to anything keying off them (#95). Everything else is
    passed through unchanged — including the credentials in ``_CHILD_ENV_KEEP``,
    which only share the prefix by accident.

    ``REMEMBER_NESTED_SUMMARIZER`` is then set as the positive counterpart to
    that stripping. Removing the parent markers is what lets the child start at
    all, and it also erases every trace that it IS a child — so the plugin's own
    hooks fire inside it, resolve a project from ``cwd`` (an isolated, per-call
    directory since #724 -- previously the shared ``gettempdir()``), and
    scaffold a memory directory there (#204). The hooks were always
    meant to no-op here; they were reading a signal this function had deleted.
    A marker we set ourselves cannot be deleted by us and cannot false-positive
    on an unrelated session, which ``CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=sdk-cli`` would.

    ``CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`` goes too. It does not carry the ``CLAUDE_CODE_``
    prefix, so it was never covered by the rule above — while #204's report, and
    ``resolve-paths.sh``'s own comments, both describe the child as having none.
    Claude Code 2.1.219 overwrites it from the sandbox cwd, so the leak is inert
    there and is not the mechanism behind any report; a CLI that honoured the
    inherited value would aim the summarizer's hooks at the REAL project, which
    is the failure @ehutchinsonSFDC saw. Cheap to close, and it makes the code
    say what the comments already claim.

#
# The Claude CLI resolves credentials in a fixed order, and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# out-ranks a claude.ai login. So an operator who has a login AND keeps that
# var set for some unrelated tool gets every nested summarizer call billed to
# the key -- and when its balance is exhausted, every background save dies with
# "Credit balance is too low" while their own interactive sessions carry on
# working off the login. Nothing at any layer names the variable; the reporter
# found it by reading the child's stderr in the daily log after days of opaque
# `save-session.sh --force exited 1` warnings.
#
# Stripping it unconditionally does not remove that failure, it relocates it:
# authenticating the CLI with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY alone is normal and documented,
# and for those installs a strip leaves the child with no credential at all and
# every save failing in exactly the same silent shape.
#
# So the strip is conditional on another credential actually being visible.
# "Visible" is the honest limit here: a claude.ai login in the macOS Keychain
# is not something this process can see without probing the operator's keychain
# (which prompts, and reads a secret we have no business reading), so `auto`
# keeps the key for those operators -- today's behaviour, not a new failure --
# and `haiku.anthropic_api_key` lets them say `strip` once. The failure hint in
# `call_haiku` is what tells them the knob exists at the moment it matters.

    to claim (mirroring the Claude path's default empty ``--allowedTools``,
    itself incomplete for the same reason -- see #724, F8/F9). Two SEPARATE
    mechanisms bound the blast radius of a command run here, for two
    SEPARATE audiences:
      * `_codex_child_env` -- the ``env=`` kwarg passed to `subprocess.run`
        -- is what CODEX'S OWN PROCESS receives from this host (its CLI
        needs PATH/HOME to run at all, plus CODEX_API_KEY/proxy/CA vars to
        authenticate and reach the network, #751).
      * the ``-c shell_environment_policy.inherit=none`` override below is
        what a COMMAND CODEX SPAWNS internally receives. These are not the
        same environment: Codex does not hand a spawned command its own
        process env by default just because that is what this host gave
        it. Before #798, nothing here set this policy at all, so a
        transcript-injected instruction that got the model to run a shell
        command inside this sandbox could read CODEX_API_KEY and the proxy
        vars directly out of that command's environment -- exactly the class
        of secret #751 had just finished making Codex's OWN process able to
        see. `_codex_child_env`'s allow-list stays necessary (Codex's own
        auth/proxy needs do not go away); it was never sufficient for this.
        Confirmed against codex-cli 0.153.2's own ``--help`` and the
        official Codex manual (fetched 2026-09-26): `shell_environment_policy`
        is a real, documented dotted-path config key, and ``-c`` overrides
        apply regardless of whether ``config.toml`` is loaded -- relevant
        since this call also passes ``--ignore-user-config``. NOT re-verified
        against codex-cli 0.150.1, the version this repo's own README pins as
        "observed working" (unlike the ``--ignore-user-config`` isolation
        claim two paragraphs below, which was) -- `ShellEnvironmentPolicyInherit`
        is a long-standing enum in Codex's own config schema, not something
        new in 0.153.2, so the risk of it being absent on 0.150.1 is judged
        low, but this is reasoned, not observed, on that specific version.
        ``inherit=none`` also means a spawned command gets NO environment at
        all -- not just no secrets, but no ``PATH``/``HOME``/locale either.
        That is a real behavioral change from "full inherit", not only a
        narrowing of what secrets are visible: a command the model tries to
        run that relies on ``PATH`` to resolve a bare command name will now
        fail to find it. Accepted here because nothing about this
        summarizer's actual job (producing the model's final text message)
        depends on a spawned command succeeding -- unlike `_codex_child_env`,
        which deliberately keeps just enough (``PATH``/``HOME``/proxy/CA) for
        Codex's OWN process to run and authenticate, this policy governs a
        code path this feature does not intend to rely on at all.
        Unit tests here can only assert the argv carries this exact string;
        none can spawn a real `codex exec` to confirm the CLI actually
        empties a spawned command's environment when given it -- that trust
        boundary (does codex-cli honor its own documented flag at runtime)
        is not verifiable from this codebase.
    the fresh, empty `cwd` this call is given (`_isolated_summarizer_cwd`,
    #724) narrows what such a command could even find to act on, but does
    not touch what it can read from its own environment -- that is this
    policy's job, not the cwd's.
    ``--skip-git-repo-check``: cwd is a temp dir, never a git repo.
    ``--ephemeral``: no session file persisted for a one-shot summarizer call.
    ``--ignore-user-config``: Codex's own equivalent of the Claude path's
    ``--setting-sources ''`` hook isolation (#202) -- verified against
    codex-cli 0.150.1 that omitting this flag runs the operator's own Codex
    hooks (including this plugin's, if installed for Codex) inside the
    nested call; ``CODEX_HOME`` auth is unaffected by it.
    ``-o``: the model's final message, and nothing else Codex prints while it
    runs, written to its own file -- avoids parsing progress/reasoning noise
    out of stdout the way ``--output-format json`` lets the Claude path avoid
    it.
    ``-``: read the prompt from stdin, not argv (mirrors the Claude path's
    E2BIG concern -- see ``call_haiku``'s docstring).
