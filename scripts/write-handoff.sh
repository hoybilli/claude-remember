# write-handoff.sh — write a handoff note to the ONE path this session
# resolved, never a path chosen by the model or parsed out of a transcript
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   The /remember skill used to instruct the model to parse its Write target
#   out of "the most recent === HANDOFF === block in this session's context"
#   -- text that any untrusted content the session ingested (a Read of a
#   hostile README, a fetched page, an issue body, or a repo-committed
#   .remember/remember.md the SessionStart hook itself cats into context,
#   #721) can supply, with Write pre-approved for any path (#720). This
#   script closes that off structurally: it takes no destination argument at
#   all. The note comes in on stdin; the destination is derived the same way
#   session-start-hook.sh derives REMEMBER_DIR, from config, never from
#   anything the model said or read.
#
# RESOLUTION
#   1. Source resolve-paths.sh + lib-memory-dir.sh to get REMEMBER_DIR, the
#      same way the hook does. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is not exported to the
#      Bash tool (#207, see doctor.sh). Claude Code runs the Bash tool with
#      the project directory as its INITIAL cwd, but that cwd is the same
#      shell state across every command in one Bash-tool call -- a `cd`
#      earlier in the call persists, so a bare `$(pwd)` fallback can be a
#      subdirectory of the project by the time this script runs, not the
#      project root itself (#743). This prefers `git rev-parse
#      --show-toplevel` when the cwd is inside a git repo -- the common
#      case, and immune to an earlier `cd` -- falling back to the plain
#      $(pwd) default only outside a git repo, same as before. #776: that
#      preference is wrong for a project deliberately started from a repo
#      SUBDIRECTORY (a supported shape), so when $(pwd) and the toplevel
#      disagree AND this session's own id is known, this checks which
#      candidate's own store already carries THIS session's session-keyed
#      handoff hint (#738) and prefers that one -- falling back to the
#      toplevel, unchanged, when neither or both do.
#   2. If the SessionStart hook this session left a resolved path at
#      $REMEMBER_DIR/tmp/handoff-path (written every session start, #720),
#      and that path's shape passes the check below, use it -- this is what
#      makes per_session mode's remember.<id>.md work without this script
#      ever seeing the session id itself.
#   3. Otherwise fall back to $REMEMBER_DIR/remember.md, the same hardcoded
#      default the skill used to fall back to.
#
# SHAPE CHECK (defense in depth, applied to BOTH paths above)
#   The resolved path's parent directory must be exactly $REMEMBER_DIR, and
#   its basename must be `remember.md` or `remember.<token>.md` where
#   <token> is restricted to [A-Za-z0-9._-]+ -- the same allowlist
#   session-start-hook.sh already applies to CURRENT_SESSION_ID before ever
#   using it in a filename. A hint file that fails this check is refused,
#   not silently widened to "write wherever it says".
#
# USAGE
#   The note is untrusted content (#742): the caller must pipe it in behind
#   a fresh, unpredictable heredoc terminator each time -- never the literal
#   `EOF` -- since a note containing a line matching the terminator exactly
#   would end the heredoc early and let the remainder be parsed as shell in
#   this same call.
#
#     fence='HANDOFF_<random>'
#     printf '%s\n' "$fence" "<handoff note>" "$fence" | \
#       bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/write-handoff.sh"
#
#   Always prints exactly one of:
#     Wrote handoff to: <path>
#     REFUSED: <reason>
#   never silence -- an unattended overwrite with no visible destination is
#   the exposure #720 and #721 exist to close, not something to keep in a
#   different form.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  written
#   1  refused (bad shape, unresolvable REMEMBER_DIR, or write failed)
