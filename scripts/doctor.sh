# doctor.sh — User-facing diagnostics command for the Remember plugin
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Manual, human-run health check. Reports plugin version, resolved paths,
#   detected tools, storage mode, and capture health (whether PostToolUse has
#   ever actually fired and produced a save, and whether SessionEnd — the
#   last-chance flush, #370 — has ever fired) in a single plain-text report.
#
#   Closes suggestion 3 of issue #200: the plugin can go silently no-op when
#   it is enabled mid-session (PostToolUse is never registered because Claude
#   Code reads hook definitions once, at session start — see issue #144 for
#   the sibling failure, a slug mismatch that no-ops the same way). This
#   script exists so a user can ask "is capture actually working?" and get a
#   direct answer instead of hours of silence.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/doctor.sh
#   Invoked by the /remember:doctor slash command (commands/doctor.md), which runs
#   this via ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doctor.sh and relays the output
#   verbatim. Safe to also run directly from a shell for the same report.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT   Plugin install directory (set by Claude Code)
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR   Project root. Claude Code exports this to *hooks*,
#                        not to the Bash tool that runs this script, so on a
#                        marketplace install it normally arrives unset here
#                        (#207). When unset, doctor.sh — and only doctor.sh,
#                        never resolve-paths.sh's other callers — defaults it
#                        to the current directory, and says so in the report
#                        instead of presenting the guess as given.
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   resolve-paths.sh  (sourced with REMEMBER_PATHS_SOFT_FAIL=1 — unlike the
#                      hooks, a resolution failure is reported as a FAIL
#                      finding here, not swallowed, since this command exists
#                      specifically to surface problems)
#   detect-tools.sh   (sourced, but only after a subshell probe: it calls
#                      `exit 1` when no python is found, which would kill a
#                      hook silently — the exact failure mode this report
#                      needs to SHOW, not die from. See lib-slug.sh's own
#                      comment on the same hazard.)
#   lib-memory-dir.sh (sourced directly, not via bootstrap-dirs.sh: this is a
#                      read-only report and must not trigger bootstrap-dirs'
#                      directory scaffold or its stderr redirect —
#                      a diagnostic tool that hides its own errors defeats
#                      the point.)
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0   Always — a diagnostic tool must print its findings, not fail to run.
#
# OUTPUT
#   Plain text, one finding per line, prefixed OK / WARN / FAIL so the report
#   greps cleanly. No colour (matches the rest of the plugin's scripts — the
#   reporting environment includes Windows Git Bash/MSYS terminals that don't
#   reliably render ANSI). Ends with a single VERDICT line.

# ── --json: machine-readable resolution surface (#408) ──────────────────────
#
# Every field this prints is already computed for the human report below —
# resolved directory, storage mode — but only in a form meant to be read by
# a person. An external caller wanting a `{slug}`-keyed external store's real
# directory had exactly two options before this: vendor session_dir_slug
# (UTF-8-aware, hashes over 200 characters, folds Windows drive letters) —
# a second copy of another project's logic, going stale on its own schedule
# — or give up and report unknown, which is what claude-oss now does
# correctly, at the cost of a real diagnostic every time (claude-oss#614).
#
# PROVISIONAL, not a stable contract: `schema_version` is 1 and will be
# bumped on any incompatible change to these keys or their meaning — a
# caller parsing this should check it rather than assume the shape below is
# permanent. This is the first release of this surface; nothing has yet
# exercised whether these three states are the right cut.
#
# Three states, not two, deliberately mirroring the ladder two sections below
# (soft-fail vs the assumed-CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR guess, #207): a caller must be
# able to tell "resolved, and trustworthy" from "resolved, but only because
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR was guessed from the current directory" from "did not
# resolve at all" — folding any two of these into one state would make
# `could_not_resolve` (or a guessed path presented as given) indistinguishable
# from the shape that error case must never take: an absent key or an empty
# object read as "nothing to report", exactly the gap claude-oss#614 hit on
# the other side of this same problem.
#
# Deliberately short-circuits before any of the human report's own output —
# a single line of JSON is the whole contract; nothing before or after it on
# stdout would still parse as one.

    # JSON string literal with a literal control character in it, which is
    # invalid per RFC 8259 and breaks any real parser this output exists to
    # be read by (#408 self-review). `[:cntrl:]` is a POSIX bracket

    # reference below turns this `//` replace from glob matching into a

# ── SessionEnd liveness (#370) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# PostToolUse's freshness-window reading above (a marker refreshed on every
# one of its many calls inside a live session) does not transfer here:
# SessionEnd fires at most once per session, so "how old is the marker" is a
# different question from "did the hook run last time it had the chance".
#
# No new marker is written for this. session-end-hook.sh already leaves
# usable evidence of its own accord, as a side effect of its background
# flush: a logs/autonomous/session-end-<HHMMSS>-<PID>.log file, created
# unconditionally once that hook gets past its own SAVE_SCRIPT-missing check
# (see session-end-hook.sh's own comments around its `_END_LOG` redirect).
# The `-<PID>` suffix (#488) is why the glob below stays a plain
# `session-end-*.log`, not `session-end-??????.log` -- narrowing it to the
# old fixed-width shape would stop matching the very files this hook now
# writes. Presence of even one such file is proof the hook has run; absence needs a
# second signal before it can be called a problem, since a hook that never
# had the chance to fire yet is not the same as one that had the chance and
# stayed silent — the third state the issue calls out by name.
#
# $_SESSION_DIR (Paths section, above) is Claude Code's own transcript
# directory for this project — one *.jsonl file per session it has ever
# started. A COUNT of files there is not evidence a session ended: two or
# more concurrently open Claude Code windows on the same project each keep
# their own transcript, live, at the same time, and neither has ended just
# because the other exists (#370 review). What distinguishes "a session
# existed and stopped being active" from "another window is open right now"
# is whether a transcript OTHER than the one currently growing has gone
# quiet — Claude Code appends to the active transcript on every turn, so a
# file nobody has touched in a while is read as no longer live. 900s (15
# minutes) is generous on purpose: false NEGATIVES here (a truly-ended
# session not yet counted) cost nothing but a delayed FAIL, while false
# POSITIVES are the failure mode #370's own review caught — a hard "problem"
# verdict for an ordinary two-windows-open workflow. It is not proof
# SessionEnd itself was invoked (its firing conditions on a crash or a
# killed terminal are undocumented; see session-end-hook.sh's own header) —

# Quietness alone is not proof of a genuine SessionEnd failure (#392): a
# transcript can go quiet because a session that ran here predates this
# project ever having a remember store, in which case no SessionEnd hook was
# ever registered to fire for it. REMEMBER_DIR's own mtime looked like the
# earliest "remember became active here" signal doctor.sh could read without
# new marker infrastructure, but it is NOT stable: save-session.sh writes
# now.md via mktemp-in-REMEMBER_DIR + mv (see save-session.sh's own Step 6
# comments), and both the mktemp and the mv update REMEMBER_DIR's own mtime,
# not just now.md's — so on any project with ongoing captures it reads as
# "time since the last save", not "time since install", reopening the exact
# false-negative window this fix exists to close (measured: a genuinely
# 2-day-old store with one ordinary save 5 minutes ago reads as installed 5
# minutes ago). $REMEMBER_DIR/.install-marker is what this reads instead
# (#401; originally $REMEMBER_DIR/.gitignore, see below): bootstrap-dirs.sh
# writes it exactly once, gated on `[ -f "$REMEMBER_DIR/.install-marker" ]
# || …`, and unlike every other path under REMEMBER_DIR it is never
# rewritten by ordinary hook activity.
#
# #401: this originally read $REMEMBER_DIR/.gitignore's mtime instead, which
# was NOT permanently stable — a legacy (in-project) store that is later
# migrated to external mode and backed up with git has that exact file
# deleted by hooks.d/after_save/50-git-backup.sh's own cleanup of the
# migration artifact ("removed per-slug .gitignore (legacy bootstrap
# artifact)") the first time a backed-up save runs, and bootstrap-dirs.sh's
# write of it is gated on the store being inside the project (`case
# "$REMEMBER_DIR" in "$_mem_proj"/*)`), which is false once external, so it
# was never recreated — permanently degrading this check to WARN-only for
# that store. EXTERNAL storage mode had the same gap from the start
# (bootstrap-dirs.sh never wrote .gitignore there either), reached via
# migration instead of from day one.
#
# $REMEMBER_DIR/.install-marker (bootstrap-dirs.sh, "Install marker (#401)")
# replaces it: written once, unconditional of storage mode, and nothing in
# this codebase — including the .gitignore cleanup above — has any reason to
# touch it again. Absent or unreadable for any reason (including a store
# that upgraded into this fix before its next hook run ever wrote one), no
# transcript can be attributed to "after install", which is the safe

# capture looks perfectly healthy sees the exact same "capture is working"
# line as one whose SessionEnd hook is unregistered or dying before it
# forks, right up until the session that ends in conversation rather than
# tool calls loses its tail with no warning at all. The ladder's own rule
# above is "specific causes before the general one" for DIFFERENT
# explanations of the SAME symptom; here it is a genuinely separate hook
# with its own failure mode, and reaching the general "capture is working"
# line first would be exactly the invisibility this issue reports, just
# moved one arm down the same ladder. It sits BELOW the no-usable-Python and
