"""Fallback for `jq -r '.dotted.key' FILE` when jq itself is not on PATH (#668).

Called from detect-tools.sh's own `_jq_fallback`, by literal path through
`_remember_run_python` (#898 round 7 -- this body used to live inline, as a
single-quoted here-string with the two embedded `.` separators escaped
through the close-emit-reopen quoting idiom; moved to its own file so the
shell side carries neither that quoting nor the embedded `for` loop a
line-oriented scanner cannot tell from real bash).

Prints nothing and exits 0 on ANY failure -- a missing key, a file that is
not valid JSON, a key argument that does not parse -- because every caller
already treats "no output" as the miss case; this mirrors `jq`'s own
silence on a null lookup rather than inventing a second failure channel.
