# lib-memory-dir.sh — Resolve REMEMBER_DIR and produce a merged REMEMBER_CONFIG
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Single source of truth for two closely coupled concerns:
#
#   1. REMEMBER_DIR — where memory data files live.
#      Normally "${PROJECT_DIR}/.remember" (legacy default).
#      When config.json carries a data_dir starting with "/" or "~", the path
#      is expanded and the {slug} placeholder is replaced with the
#      session_dir_slug of PROJECT_DIR, matching Claude Code's own naming for
#      ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/.
#
#   2. REMEMBER_CONFIG — the merged config.json that every caller reads via
#      config(). Built by deep-merging three layers (highest priority wins):
#        1. ${PIPELINE_DIR}/config.json          (plugin-bundled defaults)
#        2. ${HOME}/.remember/config.json         (user-global, survives updates)
#        3. ${REMEMBER_DIR}/config.json           (per-project override)
#
# USAGE
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/resolve-paths.sh"   # sets PROJECT_DIR, PIPELINE_DIR
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/detect-tools.sh"    # sets session_dir_slug
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/lib-memory-dir.sh"  # exports REMEMBER_DIR, REMEMBER_CONFIG
#
# REQUIRES
#   PROJECT_DIR    — set by resolve-paths.sh
#   PIPELINE_DIR   — set by resolve-paths.sh
#   session_dir_slug — sourced from lib-slug.sh (no longer needs detect-tools.sh)
#
# EXPORTS
#   REMEMBER_DIR         — absolute path to memory data directory
#   REMEMBER_STORE_ROOT  — the directory the per-project stores sit in, and empty
#                          unless data_dir is absolute AND carries {slug} (#297)
#   REMEMBER_CONFIG      — absolute path to merged config (tmp file)
#

# here without sourcing detect-tools.sh (#158). Sourcing detect-tools.sh instead

# _resolve_memory_project_dir <project_dir>
# Returns the directory memory should be keyed to. Normally this is PROJECT_DIR
# itself. When PROJECT_DIR is a *linked git worktree*, Claude Code has set
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to the worktree path — but memory should live with the main
# checkout so it survives `git worktree remove` and is shared across worktrees
# of the same repo (issue #56). A linked worktree is detected via git's common
# dir differing from its git dir; the main checkout is the parent of the shared
# common dir.
#
# Fail-safe by design: it only redirects when it positively identifies a linked
# worktree whose main checkout is a real work tree. Ordinary checkouts, non-git
# directories, bare-repo worktrees, and old git without --path-format all fall
# through to PROJECT_DIR unchanged — identical to pre-fix behaviour. Only
# REMEMBER_DIR is affected; PROJECT_DIR stays the worktree path so session
# recovery still finds transcripts under the worktree slug.

# A FUNCTION THAT ASSIGNS, not one that echoes, and it must never be called as
# `$(...)`. This file is sourced by bootstrap-dirs.sh and by log.sh, and
# post-tool-hook.sh reaches both on the tool call that resolves — the first of a
# session and the first after any config edit (#350 made the rest of them replay
# instead). session-start-hook.sh and save-session.sh reach it unconditionally.
# A command substitution here is a fork on every one of those, which is the cost
# #230 went to trouble removing and #296 refused to add back. Everything below
# is parameter expansion: no subshell, no external command, no measurable cost
# on that path.
#
# This exists because of a circularity #296 left open. The slug record lives at

# ships — "data_dir": "~/.remember/{slug}", under a _purpose that says to copy
# it — REMEMBER_DIR is itself named by the slug, so a caller had to know the
# answer to open the file holding it. The store root is the one path in that
# layout a caller CAN name: it is the part of the template before the
# placeholder, so the template alone yields it.
#
# It is deliberately empty when there is no {slug}. In the legacy layout
# (<project>/.remember) and in a single-directory external store, REMEMBER_DIR
# and the store root are the same directory and the record is already reachable
# from project_dir and the template — so there is nothing to publish, and the
# session-start index that reads this stays off. The common layout does not pay
# for the external one.
#

# expensive to leak than to occasionally over-protect.
#
# Up to three spawns, and the common "no git at all" case pays only one:
# `rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` answers "is there a work tree reachable
# from here" on its exit status alone (no output parsing, so no locale/
# translation risk from git's own error text) -- a plain non-git project
# fails it immediately and this returns `untracked` without ever running
# `ls-files`. Only once inside a real work tree does this run `rev-parse
# --show-toplevel` (#761's symlinked-.git guard) and then `ls-files

# redirection, jq's `>`, and Python's `open(path, "w")` all follow a symlink
# when opening their target and truncate on open, before a byte is written —
# so a symlink pre-seeded at the predictable name does not just get
# truncated, it receives the actual write that follows: the merged config,
# which per the comment below can carry a live `haiku.oauth_token`, lands at
# whatever path the attacker's symlink pointed to. mktemp both creates the
# file atomically (closing the create/open race a separate `: >` leaves open)
# and names it unpredictably, and is already 0600 on every mktemp this repo
# relies on (GNU and BSD/macOS alike) — no umask needed, and matching

# of X's at the very END of the template (verified against this file's own

    # the `|| cp "$_bundled_cfg" ...` fallback silently dropped EVERY
    # layer, project AND trusted user-global, with no error surfaced to
    # the user at all. This design uses NOTHING that was not already
    # proven, on every CI platform, before #740 ever touched this file:
    # the untrusted project layer is sanitized in a SEPARATE, plain call
    # (`jq -c 'del(.haiku)' "$_project_cfg"`, no `-s`, no `-n`, no
    # `--slurpfile`, no `/dev/null` placeholder, no path comparison of any
    # kind) into its own temp file, applying `del(.haiku)` to every
    # top-level JSON value the untrusted file contains -- jq's ordinary
    # (non-slurp) mode already treats each one as a separate input, so
    # this handles a multi-document project config the same way #740's
    # first fix did, and an empty file the same way its second fix did,
    # without either design's own platform-dependent moving part. Once
    # sanitized, the ORIGINAL `jq -s` reduce below (unchanged since
    # before #726) runs over the SAME plain file arguments it always did
    # -- the sanitized temp file standing in for the untrusted one -- so
    # the one thing #744 needed proof of (does this shape work on
    # Windows) is answered by history rather than reasoning.
