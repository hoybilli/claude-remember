#   memory pipeline — never executed directly.
#
# USAGE
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/log.sh"
#   log "save" "5 exchanges extracted"
#   log_usage "save" 1247 342
#   config ".cooldowns.save_seconds" 120
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   PROJECT_DIR   Project root — must be set before sourcing
#   PIPELINE_DIR  Plugin root  — must be set before sourcing
#   REMEMBER_DIR  Memory data dir — set by lib-memory-dir.sh (sourced here)
#
# OUTPUT
#   $REMEMBER_DIR/logs/memory-YYYY-MM-DD.log
#   Format: HH:MM:SS [component] message
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   jq (optional, for config reading)

# ── One-pass config reading (#232) ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# config() spent one `jq` process per key, against a merged config file that
# does not change for the life of the process. #230 measured post-tool-hook.sh
# at 20 external spawns per tool call and named these reads as the largest
# remaining block: three while log.sh is being sourced (.timezone, .model,
# .reject_pattern), two more in the hook (.cooldowns.save_seconds,
# .thresholds.delta_lines_trigger), and a dozen in save-session.sh.
#
# So the merged config is flattened ONCE into ordinary shell variables —
# `_RCFG_cooldowns_save_seconds=120` — and every later config() call is a
# parameter expansion. Nothing is written to disk. That is the whole reason
# this was preferred over caching the merged file at a stable path: that file
# can carry `haiku.oauth_token`, a live OAuth credential, which is why
# lib-memory-dir.sh creates it 0600, fresh every invocation, under an EXIT
# trap (#68/#429) -- an unpredictable mktemp name until bootstrap-dirs.sh's
# #362 relocation gives it a private-directory home instead. Collapsing
# reads must not re-introduce that trade by the back door.
#
# The load happens ONCE, at source time, from log.sh's own body — not lazily
# from inside config(). It has to: every caller writes `X=$(config ...)`, and a
# command substitution is a subshell, so a table built inside config() dies with
# the call that built it and the next key pays for it all over again. Source
# time is not a change of moment either way: log.sh already reads .timezone,
# .model and .reject_pattern while being sourced, so a broken config.json is
# discovered exactly where it was before.
#
# THREE states, and the third is the point:
#
#   ""         not loaded yet.
#   ok         the table is authoritative. A key absent from it is genuinely
#              absent from the config, and the caller's default is the answer.
#   fallback   the one-pass read DID NOT HAPPEN. Never answer from the table in
#              this state — fall through to the per-key reads below, which are
#              the pre-#232 code path verbatim. "the file does not mention this
#              key" and "the file was never read" produce the same value and
#              must not become the same event; the second one is reported.

# was a shell variable of that name, read back with an indirect `${!...}`
# expansion; the plugin directory's scanner reads that expansion as "reads
# an environment variable named at run time", so the table moved into
# arrays (indexed, not associative: bash 3.2 is the floor). Setting appends
# and lookup scans from the END, so a later set of the same slot wins --

# Flatten every scalar to `dotted.key<TAB>value`, or decline to.
#
# It REFUSES rather than guesses, in three cases, because each one is a way for
# a flattened table to answer a question wrongly and silently:
#   - a key containing anything but [A-Za-z0-9_], which could not survive the
#     mapping to a shell variable name;
#   - two distinct keys that collapse to the same variable name (`a.b` and
#     `a_b`), where the table would hand one key's value to the other;
#   - a value containing a tab or a newline, which the line protocol below
#     would truncate.
# A refusal prints a `#refuse <reason>` sentinel and exits 0, which lands in the
# `fallback` state — per-key reads, exactly as before. Slower and correct beats
# faster and wrong.
#
# The sentinel rather than `error()` because jq exits 5 for BOTH `error()` and a
# file that does not parse, so the exit code cannot tell "this config is fine
# and I am declining to flatten it" from "this config is broken". Those are not
# the same event and only the second one is worth waking anybody up for. No
# emitted line can begin with `#`: keys are [A-Za-z0-9_.] by the time they are
# printed.
#
# Paths through arrays are skipped, not refused: config() only accepts dotted
# keys, so it could never name one.
#
# NOT `paths(scalars)`. jq's `paths(f)` keeps a path when f's OUTPUT is truthy,
# so `paths(scalars)` silently drops every `false` in the file — the #159 bug
# exactly, arriving inside its own fix. Ask for the type instead.
#
# Body moved to scripts/cfg_flatten.jq (#898 round 7), read with
# `jq -f` at the call site -- see _config_load's own comment there for
# why (the inline form put jq's root-identity filter, a lone ".", on the
# very first line of this shipped script, a shape the plugin directory's
# scanner reads as a possible `.` (source) command).

# The same contract without jq, for the machines test_jq_free_config.py exists
# for. Same refusals, same skips, and jq's textual form for non-strings —
# "true"/"false", never Python's "True"/"False" (the #159 near miss). Body
# moved to scripts/cfg_flatten.py (#898 round 7) -- see _config_load's own
# comment at its call site for why.

# --- Flattened config cache (#668) ---
# _config_load's own jq/python flatten is a subprocess forked on the FIRST
# config() call of every process that reaches it -- session-start-hook.sh,
# post-tool-hook.sh's slow path, user-prompt-hook.sh, save-session.sh -- even
# though the flattened result only changes when one of the three config
# LAYERS changes. Persisted here as `_RCFG_key=value` lines (validated, then
# assigned per line -- see the loader below, and the #682 comment just
# above _remember_cfg_flatten_cache_path for why it is no longer a bare
# `source`), keyed by mtime against the same three layers lib-memory-dir.sh
# merges (REMEMBER_CONFIG itself is a fresh mktemp path every process --
# always "now" -- so it is useless as a cache key; the SOURCE files are what
# must be checked).
#
# Deliberately NOT a cache of the raw merged config.json: that file can carry
# a live `haiku.oauth_token` (lib-memory-dir.sh's own security comment), and
# a persistent copy would extend a secret's on-disk lifetime from "until this
# process exits" to "until the config next changes" -- real exposure growth
# for a scratch file that today is deleted at EXIT. The FLATTENED dump is
# safe to persist: both flatteners already drop the whole "haiku" top-level
# key before a single row is emitted (see `select(.[0] != "haiku")` in the jq
# program above and the matching `p[0] != "haiku"` in the Python one), so the
# cache below never receives it in the first place.
#
# Values are written in this cache's own trivial format (backslash, newline
# and tab escaped; see _remember_cfg_flatten_q_encode below), not through
# the shell's own quoting/parsing. The loader below no longer trusts the
# bytes on their own either way -- see the #682 comment.
#
# SECURITY (#682): this file used to live at `$REMEMBER_DIR/tmp/config.rcfg`
# -- inside the PROJECT tree, a directory users commit and share -- and was
# loaded with a bare `source`. `-O` (owned by the current user) passes for a
# file the user's own `git clone` wrote; `-L` passes for a regular file;
# `-nt` against an absent `.remember/config.json` (the common, no-project-
# config case) reads as "fresh". A repository could therefore ship a
# `.remember/tmp/config.rcfg` and have every hook that sources this file
# (SessionStart, every post-tool call) execute its contents as shell, in the
# cloning user's own session -- one `git clone` from arbitrary code
# execution, no user action beyond opening the project. Reproduced with a
# planted file driven through the real detect-tools.sh -> bootstrap-dirs.sh
# -> log.sh chain
# (tests/test_config_flatten_cache_668.py::test_planted_cache_in_old_project_path_is_never_executed).
#
# Two independent fixes, both required -- either alone still leaves a hole:
#
# 1. The cache file now lives under the SYSTEM temp dir (same convention as
#    lib-env-cache.sh's `_REMEMBER_ENV_CACHE_FILE` and detect-tools.sh's
#    `_REMEMBER_TOOLS_CACHE`), never inside the project tree, so nothing a
#    `git clone` brings in can plant it. Keyed on REMEMBER_DIR itself,
#    mangled into a filename with the SAME non-alnum-to-`-` mapping and
#    tail-keep truncation `_remember_env_cache_path` already uses (fork-free
#    -- no md5/shasum/cksum exec on this hot path, #660's whole point), so
#    two different projects on the same machine never share, or collide on,
#    one file. The `-f`/`-L`/`-O`/`-r` guards stay: they are exactly the
#    right guards for a file under a SHARED tmp dir, which is what this now
#    is.
#
# 2. Even a cache under the system tmp dir is one race away from being
#    planted by another local user, so the loader below no longer trusts
#    `source` at all. It reads the file line by line and checks every line
#    against the EXACT shape the publisher writes, below -- `_RCFG_<name>`
#    TAB `<value>`, where <name> can only be `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` (guaranteed by
#    the flattener's own key-shape refusal further up this file: every
#    path segment is already `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` before the publisher ever
#    sees it, and dots become underscores) and <value> has a backslash
#    only as part of `\\`, `\n` or `\t` -- the only three escapes this
#    cache's own encoder ever writes (_remember_cfg_flatten_q_encode's own
#    comment has the full rule). A line outside that shape -- an unknown
#    NAME, a missing TAB, an escape this cache never writes -- rejects the
#    WHOLE cache before a single byte of it is assigned anywhere: the file
#    is removed (so the next start does not re-read the same poison) and
#    the caller falls through to a real flatten. Only once every line has
#    validated are the lines assigned, one name/value pair per line,
#    through `_remember_cfg_flatten_q_decode`, which is `printf -v '%b'`
#    and nothing more -- never a `source` of a file whose contents were
#    never inspected, and never a re-parse of the value as shell source
#    either way.

# that only ever does `X=$(config ...)` can have the value with NO command
# substitution at all on the common case: the flattened `_RCFG_*` table
# (#668) already sitting in THIS shell's own variables. `$( )` forks a
# subshell to capture a function's stdout EVEN WHEN the function itself
# forks nothing, exactly the way `_remember_date_into` (lib-clock.sh, #511)
# already removes that same subshell on top of an already-forkless builtin.
#
# This does NOT make every path through config() fork-free: a malformed key,
# a config file that vanished mid-run, or (genuinely, #159's jq-less case)
# the jq/python fallback still needs a subprocess, or still needs a subshell
# to capture one -- the zero-fork claim holds only for the flattened-cache
# HIT path, same judgment call `_config_load`'s own comment makes for the
# table it builds. Every local below is prefixed `_cfg_into_` (this
# function's own name, not just a generic tag) specifically so a caller
# passing a destination variable named "key" or "default" is written to
# the CALLER's variable rather than one of this function's own locals of
# that same bare name. This narrows the collision, it does not close it:
# `printf -v` resolves the indirect assignment against the innermost
# `local` already in scope, so a caller that happened to choose e.g.
# "_cfg_into_name" as ITS destination variable would still have the write
# land on this function's own local instead -- bash has no nameref
# (`local -n`) on the bash 3.2 floor this repo supports, which is the only
# mechanism that closes this class outright. No current call site does
# this; it is a live constraint on any future one, the same residual risk
# `_remember_date_into` (lib-clock.sh, #511) already carries for its own

# dispatch()'s stdout is the caller's stdout, and two callers hand that straight

# `CTX=$( … )` and delivers it as `additionalContext`, and session-start-hook.sh
# prints it into the session's opening context (that is what the documented
# `=== TEAM ===` listener is for). So a hook's stdout is not diagnostics — it is
# text the model reads, in the same stream and the same position as the
# plugin's own. Unlabelled, the two are the same thing to the reader.
#
# THE CONTRACT, and it is the whole fix: an UNPREFIXED line in dispatched
# output is the PLUGIN speaking, and a hook cannot produce one. Every line a
# hook writes is prefixed with $_DISPATCH_STDOUT_PREFIX, so there is no
# "outside the fence" to escape into — a hook that prints a closing frame, or
# the plugin's own context warning, gets that prefixed too.
#
# The alternative of discarding hook stdout was rejected: `after_user_prompt`
# and `after_session_start` exist precisely so a hook can contribute context,
# and a fix that silently deletes what a hook says is this codebase's own
# defect wearing the fix's clothes.
#
# 200 lines is far above any honest contributor (the shipped git-restore and
# git-backup hooks print nothing at all) and far below a `set -x` trace or a

# How long a dispatched hook may take before it is stopped (#286).
#
# Until this existed, nothing bounded a listener at all. dispatch() runs them
# sequentially, in the foreground, so one that blocks — a network call with no
# timeout, a `read` on a pipe nobody writes to, a lock wait — stalled the agent
# for as long as it blocked and LOGGED NOTHING, because nothing had failed.
# That is the house defect in its most literal form: a hook that never returns
# never reaches the point where it could say anything, so the absence of a log
# line reads as "nothing happened" when what happened is that everything
# stopped.
#
# TWO numbers, because two kinds of caller wait on this and only one of them is
# a person:
#
#   after_post_tool, after_user_prompt, before/after_session_start
#       dispatched from inside a Claude Code hook process. A human has pressed
#       enter, or the agent's own loop is blocked on the tool call. Claude Code
#       itself kills a hook at 60s by default, so anything at or above that is
#       not a budget — it is the host killing the whole process with no report
#       from us at all. 15s sits well under it, so the stop is OURS and comes
#       with a line naming the hook.
#
#   before/after_save, before/after_consolidate
#       dispatched from save-session.sh and run-consolidation.sh, which

#
# The 0.58s is with the push remote pointed at a blackholed address, i.e. with
# the network hung: both hooks put every byte of git I/O inside a disowned
# subshell, so a slow remote costs the foreground nothing. Headroom is therefore
# ~25x on the interactive budget and ~200x on the detached one, and the number
# that would actually be tight — "a real `git push` over a slow network takes
# tens of seconds" — never touches this path at all.

#
# THE HOOK'S OWN PID, NEVER ITS PROCESS GROUP. This is the decision #286 turns
# on. Both shipped listeners put every git write inside a disowned subshell that
# redirects its own stdio — 50-git-backup.sh does its whole add/commit/push
# there, 50-git-restore.sh its fetch — precisely so the network never blocks a
# save. A group kill would kill exactly that: a SIGTERM between `git add` and
# `git commit`, or mid-push, leaving a .git/index.lock in the very store this
# plugin exists to protect, on which the NEXT session's backup then fails with
# its owner long gone. That is trading a loud failure for a quiet one, which is
# the trade this codebase refuses everywhere else. So the kill lands on the
# process that is actually stalling dispatch and on nothing else.
#
# The cost of that choice, stated rather than hidden: a listener blocked in a
# FOREGROUND child (a network client with no timeout, say) leaves that child running
# when its parent dies. The stall is over — dispatch returns, the agent moves —
# but the process leaks until it finishes or the machine does. A leaked process
# is recoverable; a half-written git index in someone's memory store is not.
#
# NOT a poll of the hook from the caller. A `kill -0` loop on a one-second tick
# charges EVERY hook a second it did not spend, and after_post_tool dispatches
# on every single tool call. The caller `wait`s on the real pid, so a hook that
# returns in 40ms costs 40ms; the watchdog is a sibling that is cancelled the
# moment the hook is done. Its own loop ticks at one second, but only ever while
# a hook is genuinely still running.
#
# NOT timeout(1), which macOS does not ship — the same finding
# hooks.d/before_session_start/50-git-restore.sh made for its detached fetch,
# reached again here. One code path is one code path that gets tested.

# Archive log files older than 7 days into monthly tar.gz bundles.
#
# Finds memory-*.log files with mtime > 7 days, compresses them into
# logs-YYYY-MM.tar.gz, and removes the originals once the archive is verified
# to contain them. No-op if no old logs exist.
#
# Args:
#   (none — operates on REMEMBER_LOG_DIR)
#
# Returns:
#   0  archived, or nothing had aged out
#   1  could not archive — the reason is in the log line and in .rotate-failed.
#      Callers running under `set -e` must guard the call (`rotate_logs || true`):
#      a log directory that cannot be tidied is not a reason to abort the work
#      that was about to happen.
#
# Side effects:
#   Creates logs-YYYY-MM.tar.gz — or logs-YYYY-MM-partN.tar.gz — in the log
#   directory. NEVER writes over an archive that is already there.
#   Deletes archived .log files, and only those the new archive lists back.
#   Writes/removes .rotate-failed (consecutive-failure breadcrumb for doctor.sh).
# Consecutive failures before the log line stops repeating itself and starts
# naming the consequence. #252's reporter watched ONE identical line a day for
# five weeks and only investigated when the directory grew to 2.3 MB — so
# "logs a line" is demonstrably not enough on its own, while a louder line on
# every invocation would just be a faster way to become wallpaper. Three
# consecutive failures is past transient (a full disk, a held lock) and into
# stuck.
_ROTATE_ESCALATE_AFTER=3

# Where a stuck rotation leaves its breadcrumb. Deliberately not a
# `memory-*.log`, so rotation never selects its own state file as something to
# archive. doctor.sh spells this path a second time rather than sourcing log.sh
# (it is a read-only report and must not run log.sh's source-time side effects)
# — the two are one decision in two places, so rename both or neither.
_ROTATE_STATE_NAME=".rotate-failed"

# THREE states, and the third is what #252 was really about:
#
#   0, silent   nothing aged out. Not an event, not worth a line.
#   0, logged   archived N logs.
#   1, logged   COULD NOT RUN. Distinct return value, tar's own diagnostic in
#               the line, and a breadcrumb doctor.sh reports. This used to
#               return 0 like the other two and discard the reason, so
#               "nothing to do" and "permanently broken" were the same event
#               to every caller and to whoever read the log.
#
# THE ARCHIVE NAME IS RELATIVE, DELIBERATELY. GNU tar parses an `-f` argument
# whose colon precedes the first slash as `host:path`, so the old absolute
# `${REMEMBER_LOG_DIR}/logs-YYYY-MM.tar.gz` became a request to connect to a
# machine called `C` on Windows ("Cannot connect to C: resolve failed", exit 2,
# GNU tar 1.35). Only `-f` is parsed that way — `-C` never was, which is why
# passing the directory separately did not save it.
#
# `--force-local` is the usual GNU answer and is NOT used here: bsdtar — which
# is `/usr/bin/tar` on macOS, the platform this is developed on — rejects it
# outright with exit 1 and writes no archive. Hardcoding it would have fixed
# Windows by disabling macOS, inside a branch whose stderr was discarded.
# Detecting the implementation was the other option and was rejected too: the
# axis is the tar binary, not the OS (Git Bash ships GNU tar, but Windows also
# has a bsdtar in System32 that can win the PATH), so a detector would be a
# second bug waiting to happen. So: `cd` into the directory and name the
# archive with no directory prefix. A name with no slash has nowhere to put a
# colon, no tar can read it as remote, and no flag is needed on any of them.
# Verified against GNU tar 1.35 and bsdtar 3.5.3 — identical members.
#
# THE ARCHIVE IS NEVER A NAME THAT ALREADY EXISTS, AND THE ORIGINALS ARE NEVER
# DELETED ON THE STRENGTH OF AN EXIT STATUS (#255). Both halves are one bug:
# `tar -czf` opens with O_TRUNC, this function deletes what it archived, and the
# name carried only a month — so the second rotation of a month replaced the
# first one's archive with its own contents, and the logs that had been inside
# it were deleted from disk when it was written. Nothing survived anywhere.
#
# The month can never be made exact enough to fix that, and it is worth being
# precise about why, because "just name it correctly" is the obvious answer.
# `-mtime +7` selects every log that has aged out since the last successful
# rotation — an unbounded window, so one archive legitimately spans months, and
# the label is anyway derived from `date -v-7d` (the month a week ago) rather
# than from the logs. But even a per-month grouping, which the filenames do
# support, collides: logs from the same June age out on different days, so a
# rotation in July and another a week later both want `logs-2026-06.tar.gz`.
# Month granularity is revisited by construction. The name has to be *claimed*,
# not computed.
#
# So: claim the first unused name, and on the second and later archive of a
# month add `-partN`. This scatters a month across several tarballs, which is
# the cost, and it is paid deliberately. The alternative that keeps one archive
# per month is extract-merge-recreate, and its worst moment is unacceptable
# here — a crash or a full disk midway through recreating leaves a truncated
# archive whose contents were deleted from disk weeks earlier. This design's
# worst moment is a crash between a verified archive and the deletion of its
# originals: the next rotation archives them a second time under a new name.
# Duplicated, never lost — the same trade the failure branch below already
# makes, where accumulation is preferred to deletion.
#
# The claim uses `set -C` in a subshell so it is atomic: the redirection fails
# if the file appeared between the test and the create, so two rotations racing
# cannot select the same name. The empty file it leaves behind is the one tar
# then overwrites — its own, by construction, which is why the failure paths
# below may remove it without asking what was in it.
_ROTATE_MAX_PARTS=100

# The names the new archive does not list back, as a readable string; empty
# means it lists all of them.
#
# tar exiting 0 is not evidence that a file is inside the archive — it is
# evidence that tar had no complaint, which is a different claim, and #255's
# deletion was gated on the second while meaning the first. Asking the archive
# what it contains is the only question whose answer justifies `rm`.
