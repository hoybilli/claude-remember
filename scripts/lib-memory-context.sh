# lib-memory-context.sh — render the injected MEMORY section, and cache it
# across SessionStart runs (#668, part of #660)
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   session-start-hook.sh used to read, size, head and concatenate six memory
#   files plus the rotated-slice listing on EVERY single session start, even
#   though the bytes only change when a memory file changes -- i.e. after a
#   save or a consolidation, both of which already run in a detached
#   background phase (nohup ... & disown) before the next session starts.
#
#   This file is the single source of truth for that render, used by:
#     - session-start-hook.sh, on the foreground path: a cache hit skips the
#       render entirely (one `cat`); a miss renders live, same as before #668,
#       and additionally leaves a fresh cache behind for the next start.
#     - save-session.sh / run-consolidation.sh, at the very end of their own
#       body: both already run fully detached (see the `nohup ... & disown`
#       call sites in session-start-hook.sh and agy-stop-hook.sh), so a call
#       placed at their tail costs the interactive session nothing -- the
#       parent hook has already exited by the time either script reaches it.
#
#   Kept in one function rather than two copies for the same reason #158
#   documents for session_dir_slug: a second, independently-maintained render
#   is how the cache and the live path silently drift apart.
#
# CACHE VALIDATION
#   `$REMEMBER_DIR/tmp/start-context.cache` (raw bytes to inject) plus
#   `$REMEMBER_DIR/tmp/start-context.manifest` (one `SRC=<path>` line per
#   input the render depends on: the six memory files, REMEMBER_DIR itself --
#   so a rotated slice appearing or disappearing invalidates the cache even if
#   whatever created it forgot to republish -- and the three config layers,
#   since MEMORY_INJECT_MAX_BYTES is read from config()).
#
#   A hit requires the cache to be STRICTLY NEWER (`-nt`) than every manifest
#   entry that exists. Not `-ge`: two mtimes that compare EQUAL are treated as
#   a miss, never a hit, because FAT/exFAT's 2s mtime granularity can make a
#   source edited a moment after the cache was written compare equal to it --
#   an ambiguous read must invalidate, not serve stale content. `-nt` already
#   has this property (bash's `-nt` is false on a tie), so no special-casing is
#   needed beyond using it consistently, the same convention lib-env-cache.sh
#   already established for this codebase. `-nt` against a manifest entry that
#   does not exist is true, which is correct: an absent memory file cannot have
#   changed.
#
#   Only the non-`compact` render is cached. At `source=compact` the injection
#   is a different, much smaller shape (identity only; everything else is
#   named, not shown) -- caching that too would need a second cache keyed on
#   SESSION_START_SOURCE, and `compact` is already the cheap branch (it skips
#   reading five of the six files), so there is little to save there and real
#   risk in conflating the two shapes under one cache key.
#
# SECURITY
#   Same convention as lib-env-cache.sh and the promo marker: the cache lives
#   under REMEMBER_DIR/tmp, is written 0600 via mktemp + rename (never a
#   truncating redirect to a predictable name), and is read only when it is a
#   regular file owned by the current user -- a symlink or another user's file
#   is never trusted, and the loader falls back to a live render instead.

# available. Reads SESSION_START_SOURCE from the environment; unset/empty is
# treated as the non-compact (full) render, same as the original code.
# bash 3.2 (the documented floor -- lib-clock.sh's own header, lib-lock.sh's
# _lock_timing_key comment) has no associative arrays, so the per-file byte
# counts `_remember_render_memory_section` batches below live in a variable
# named after the sanitized path instead, exactly like lib-lock.sh's own
# `_lock_timing_key` does for the same reason. `declare -A` parses as a
# syntax error... no, it does not -- it is ACCEPTED and silently creates a
# plain, non-associative array on bash 3.2 (`declare: -A: invalid option` is
# non-fatal), so the very next `${arr[$key]}` lookup throws a fatal "syntax
# error: operand expected" instead, aborting the whole render with nothing
# injected and nothing visible beyond stderr (#662/#664 self-review finding).

# INJECTION GUARD -- "may this memory file be injected?" (#721 follow-ups:
# GHSA-6q55-m29c-3xgj, #754, #755, #756, #760)
# ============================================================================
# One shared decision, used for EVERY file the context loader injects (and
# also the handoff, session-start-hook.sh's own separate render path --
# see _remember_may_inject below). Refuses:
#
#   - a SYMLINK (`[ -L ]`), in EVERY storage mode. A cloned repository can
#     commit `.remember/now.md` (or any other injected file) as a symlink
#     to a path outside the repo -- e.g. `~/.aws/credentials` -- and have
#     THAT file's bytes read through the link and injected as though they
#     were the user's own memory. Refused unconditionally, not "only when
#     the resolved target is outside the store": nothing in this plugin
#     ever creates a symlink inside a memory store (no `ln -s` anywhere
#     under scripts/*.sh), so there is no legitimate in-store symlink this
#     would need to spare. Not gated on legacy/in-project storage either
#     (unlike the tracked check below): #757's own first-run migration
#     (`bootstrap-dirs.sh`'s `mv "$_legacy_dir" "$REMEMBER_DIR"`) carries a
#     legacy store's files, symlink and all, into the external store, so
#     restricting this check to legacy mode would leave a migrated symlink
#     unrefused from that point on.
#   - a GIT-TRACKED file, asked about BY THE FILE ITSELF: whether the
#     nearest repository above the file's OWN directory tracks it, found
#     by walking the FILESYSTEM for `.git` (_remember_repo_root_walk_into,
#     no `git` spawn) rather than by comparing REMEMBER_ROOT /
#     MEMORY_PROJECT_DIR / PROJECT_DIR against each other. #747 and #756
#     were exactly that comparison anchoring on the wrong root from a
#     linked worktree; #754 was a fixed `.git`-in-one-directory lookup that
#     a repository SUBDIRECTORY has none of. Walking the filesystem needs
#     neither fact and resolves the nearest repository itself --
#     worktree, subdirectory or submodule alike. A repository can ship a
#     memory file committed; this plugin never commits one itself
#     (bootstrap-dirs.sh writes a .gitignore for the whole directory), so a
#     tracked one was shipped by the repository, not written by the user's
#     own /remember. Gated on legacy/in-project storage only
#     (_remember_in_project_store): external storage can legitimately be
#     the user's own git-backup repository, and this plugin commits into
#     THAT one on purpose -- see that function's own comment.
#   - a file a repository IS there to answer about, but git's answer could
#     not be trusted (#760: missing binary, corrupted `.git`, a broken
#     shim on PATH). This is a THIRD state, not folded into "not tracked":
#     see _remember_file_tracked_state_into's own comment.
#   - a file reached through a SYMLINKED DIRECTORY somewhere between it
#     and the repository root (most commonly `.remember` itself, if a
#     repository commits it as a symlink rather than a directory). The
#     per-file symlink check above only ever sees the file at the far end
#     of the link, already resolved, and `git ls-files` records a
#     symlinked directory as one blob with nothing "under" it, so neither
#     check alone catches this shape -- see the `symlinked-ancestor` state
#     _remember_file_tracked_state_into documents and produces. Gated the
#     same way the tracked check is (a repository has to be found first),
#     so a user-chosen external store reached through its own symlink
#     stays exempt, exactly like the tracked check just above.
#   - nothing else. A file with no repository anywhere above it (external-
#     storage mode's ordinary case) is passed through unchanged, exactly
#     as before this guard existed.
#
# Every refusal is LOGGED via log() (never silent); the caller is expected
# to also surface it in whatever it hands back to the model/user --
# _remember_may_inject only decides and records, it does not itself print
# anything user-visible.
#
# Spawn budget (#754/#755/#756/#760 note, #660/#665/#689 fork-count tests):
# repository existence costs NO `git` spawn at all (a filesystem walk, see
# _remember_repo_root_walk_into) and asking what is tracked costs at most
# ONE `git` spawn per DISTINCT (repository root, file's own directory)
# pair, cached, scoped to that one directory via an `:(icase)` pathspec
# rather than listing the whole repository -- `git -C root ls-files` with
# NO pathspec lists everything the repository has ever committed, which on
# a large monorepo is a listing many orders of magnitude bigger than the
# handful of memory files this guard actually needs an answer about. A
# typical render touches at most two distinct directories (REMEMBER_DIR,
# and REMEMBER_ROOT only for the identity.md fallback), so this is at most
# two scoped `git` spawns per render, cached via the same indirect-variable
# convention _remember_wc_size_set (above) uses for the same
# bash-3.2-has-no-associative-arrays reason. `:(icase)` (pathspec magic,
# present since git 1.8, well below anything a supported CI runner ships)
# is what keeps a repository-committed DIFFERENTLY-CASED directory (e.g.
# `.Remember/remember.md` on a case-insensitive filesystem) detectable
# without a second, unscoped listing: a pathspec of `:(icase).remember/`
# matches a tracked `.Remember/remember.md` even though a byte-exact
# pathspec would not.

# carries a byte it considers unusual -- ALWAYS for a literal backslash,
# double quote, or control byte, and ALSO for any byte >= 0x80 unless
# core.quotePath=false is set (#774 disables that half; this handles the
# half quotePath cannot touch, found in #774's own self-review: a tracked
# path containing a literal backslash or double quote was still quoted,
# and the guard's comparison is a literal string match against the raw,
# unquoted path, so it still silently answered "not tracked"). `printf
# '%b'` expands exactly this escape set (it is the same table `echo -e`
# uses) back into the original bytes, so unquoting is one call, not a
# hand-rolled parser -- and it is applied unconditionally: an UNQUOTED

#                    default/NTFS, delivers the same bytes off disk

#                    between FILE's own directory and the repository root
#                    (inclusive of both ends) is itself a symlink. The

# Args: $1 -- a file. $2 -- its size in bytes. Writes its bytes to stdout,

# Replaces an unconditional `cat "$MFILE"` (#660). A fork is expensive on Git
# Bash, so a small file is cheaper read by the shell -- but bash's `read`
# processes the delimiter byte by byte, and that is catastrophic at size.
# Measured on windows-latest, five iterations each (the workflow's own
# "cat vs read probe" step, which exists to keep this honest):
#
#     size     cat      read
#     4KB      0.197s   0.025s     <- read wins by 8x

# ubuntu-latest has the same shape (4MB: 0.008s vs 0.879s), so this is not a
# Windows quirk. The first version of this function used `read`
# unconditionally and made the big-store arms of the benchmark measurably
# SLOWER -- a fork-count optimisation that cost seconds, which is exactly what
# counting forks alone cannot see.
#
# The threshold is deliberately well below the ~34KB crossover implied by
# those numbers: being wrong towards `cat` costs one fork, being wrong towards
# `read` costs seconds.
#
# `read -d ''` reads to the first NUL -- i.e. the whole file, for text -- into
# a variable, using no subprocess at all, and `printf %s` writes it back
# verbatim. It returns non-zero at EOF having ALREADY set the variable, which
# is why the `|| :` is correct rather than sloppy.
#
# What this deliberately is NOT: `printf '%s\n' "$(<"$1")"`. Command
# substitution strips EVERY trailing newline and the printf adds exactly one
# back, so a file ending in two newlines, or in none, renders differently from
# what is on disk -- silently, in the model's injected context.
# tests/test_render_is_byte_identical_660.py pins all six shapes and carries a
# demonstration that the naive form fails them.
#
# A file containing a literal NUL would be truncated here where `cat` would
# have passed it through. Memory files are markdown this plugin wrote itself;
# a NUL in one is already a corrupted store, and injecting the bytes after it
# was never the more useful behaviour.

# ============================================================================
# SESSION-START TOTAL BUDGET (#842)
# ============================================================================
# Claude Code persists hook stdout over roughly 10,000 CHARACTERS to a file
# and hands the model only a short preview plus the file's path -- so a
# SessionStart body that fits comfortably in a terminal can still never
# reach the model if its TOTAL crosses that line. Per-file
# memory_inject_max_bytes (above) cannot fix this: it caps one file at a
# time and has no way to prefer one memory section over another when the
# total, not any single file, is the problem (#842's own repro: six
# healthy files summing to 11-14.7KB).
#
# Budget is counted in BYTES, not characters, on purpose. Claude Code's own
# cap is reported in characters, and measuring actual Unicode codepoints
# portably across this plugin's three supported shells (stock macOS bash
# 3.2, Linux bash, Git Bash on Windows) is not reliable: bash's own
# `${#var}` length is locale-sensitive (multibyte-aware only when the
# shell's build and the active locale both support it), while `wc -c`
# always counts bytes, unconditionally, everywhere this plugin already
# relies on it for memory_inject_max_bytes above. A byte is never SHORTER
# than the character it is part of in UTF-8, so counting bytes can only be
# as-strict-or-stricter than the real character cap, never looser: staying
# under a 9000-BYTE budget guarantees staying under a 9000-CHARACTER one
# too, with margin to spare under Claude Code's ~10,000. The failure mode
# on the conservative side is listing a file by name that would, in fact,
# have fit under the real character cap -- strictly better than the
# alternative, which is the bug this file exists to fix.

# _remember_apply_session_start_budget VARNAME MAX_BYTES
#
# VARNAME names a variable holding the already-assembled SessionStart body
# (handoff block + REMEMBER legend + MEMORY section, in that order -- see
# the call site in session-start-hook.sh). When the body's byte length
# exceeds MAX_BYTES, whole memory files are left out -- never truncated
# mid-content -- in REVERSE priority order (archive.md, then today-*.md,
# then recent.md, then now.md) until it fits or all four are gone, and the
# renderer lists each one it left out by path and size. Handoff and the
# identity/core-memories head are never touched: #842's own priority order
# is handoff -> now -> recent -> today -> archive.
#
# How, and why not by cutting the body (review of #845). The first version
# searched the captured body for each file's "--- BASENAME ---" header and
# cut around the first match with ${text%%"$h"*} / ${text#*"$h"}. Both
# defects of that shape are structural, so the fix is too:
#   - bash 3.2 and 5 evaluate those expansions in time that grows with the
#     SQUARE of the body (one ${t#*"$h"} measured ~5s at 80 KB, ~72s at
#     320 KB), and this only ever runs on a body that is already big;
#   - the first match is not the real section: the handoff (file content,
#     the #721 threat model) and every earlier memory file are content, and
#     a header-shaped line in either moved the cut into them -- removing the
#     handoff's random-token fence and "=== MEMORY ===", and listing a file
#     as dropped whose content was still injected.
# So nothing here searches content. The MEMORY section is re-rendered with
# _REMEMBER_BUDGET_EXCLUDE naming the files to leave out, and the renderer
# decides inclusion per section BEFORE emitting it. The head (everything
# before the MEMORY section) is recovered by LENGTH, not by a marker: the
# memory section is the body's tail, so head = the first
# ${#body} - ${#memory} bytes, and that split is trusted only after the tail
# is confirmed byte-identical to a fresh render. ${var:off:len} and string
# equality are both linear. A mismatch (a memory file changed between the
# two renders) leaves the body untouched and logs it -- the pre-#842 shape,
# never a cut at a guessed offset.
#
# Cost: none on the common path. An under-budget body returns at the length
# check below, before any render, fork or copy; only an over-budget body
# pays for the renders (one, plus at most one per dropped file).
#
# MAX_BYTES <= 0 or non-numeric disables the budget outright (0 is a
# deliberate "no cap", the same convention every other threshold in this
# file uses).
#
# #878: if the body is STILL over budget once every droppable section is
# gone (the head -- handoff + identity/core-memories -- is never dropped,
# and can alone exceed a tightly configured MAX_BYTES), this function logs
# a WARNING naming the final size and MAX_BYTES before returning. Never a
# failure -- the body is still delivered in full, dropped sections and
# all -- but without that log line an operator cannot tell "budget
# satisfied" from "budget exhausted, still over" by reading the log alone.
