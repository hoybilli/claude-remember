# Releasing

`main` carries everything: the plugin, its 300 test files, the docs and their images, the
maintainer tooling, and a CHANGELOG.md over 600 KiB. The Anthropic plugin directory does not
accept that. Its pre-submission checklist holds any version whose plugin folder has more than
512 files, or a file of 256 KiB or more that is not an image or font. A `.gitattributes` with
`export-ignore`, `export-subst` or `filter` (any content-rewriting attribute, including in a
`.gitattributes` above the plugin folder) is worse than a hold: validation stops with "Couldn't
validate that repository". On v0.36.0 the directory fetched 474 files and 9.2 MB and then
reported "Validation ran out of time"
([#851](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/851)).

So there are two branches people install from:

| Branch | Who reads it | What decides the version they get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | the DPT marketplace (`dpt-plugins`), manual installs | `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` on `main` |
| `release` | the Anthropic directory, which has followed `release` since 2026-10-02 (see "Switching the listing to `release`" below) | the latest commit on `release`, which only the release workflow writes |

`release` is built by [`.github/workflows/release-branch.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-branch.yml)
from a tag. It never shares history with `main`: each release is one commit on top of the
previous release commit, and its message names the tag and the `main` commit it came from.

**The `publish` job refuses to push a tree whose `plugin.json` version is not strictly greater
than `release`'s current one** ([#856](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/856)):
pushing a patch tag for an older line (say `v0.36.2`) after `v0.37.0` is already on `release` would
otherwise land `0.36.2` on top of it, and every install pinned to `release` would see the version
drop. If you really do need to publish an older line on purpose, re-run the workflow via
`workflow_dispatch` with the `allow_version_regression` input set.

## The sequence

1. **Fold `changelog.d/` into a `## [x.y.z]` section of CHANGELOG.md and bump every version
   site**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, the README version badge,
   CHANGELOG.md (the list lives in `.oss.json`, `version_sites`).
   *Why:* DPT-marketplace installs follow `main`, and the `version` field in `plugin.json` is the
   only thing that tells them there is something new. The tag does not matter to them.

2. **Run the full suite (`pytest`) and commit the release on `main`.** In this repository that is
   a direct `chore(release): x.y.z` commit on `main`, not a pull request: v0.35.0 to v0.37.0 were
   all made that way, and `.oss.json` leaves `merge_method` unset (`null`).
   *Why:* that commit is what gets tagged; CI across three OSes is the gate.

3. **Tag that commit `vx.y.z` and push the tag with your own credentials**:
   `git tag vx.y.z <release-commit-sha> && git push origin vx.y.z`, then check it landed with
   `git ls-remote --tags origin vx.y.z`.
   *Why:* **pushing the tag is what publishes to the directory now.** The tag push starts the
   `release branch` workflow, and that workflow is the only thing that writes `release`. No tag,
   no directory update, and the tag is no longer only for the releases page.
   *Why your own credentials:* a tag pushed by another workflow with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not start
   workflows (GitHub suppresses them to prevent loops). The oss release flow pushes the tag with
   `git push origin <tag>` from the maintainer's checkout, which does start it.

4. **Watch the `release branch` run** (Actions tab, or `gh run list --workflow release-branch.yml`).
   It has two jobs:
   - `verify`, read-only: installs PyYAML, builds the tree from the tag, runs
     [`check_release_tree.py`](../.github/scripts/check_release_tree.py) (the directory's
     pre-submission checklist), installs the pinned claude CLI (`cli_version` in
     [`.github/release-branch.json`](../.github/release-branch.json), 2.1.287 as of 2026-10-02 --
     moved out of the workflow's own env block in #866 so another repository reusing this tooling
     only edits config) and runs `claude plugin validate --strict`, then runs
     every hook in `hooks/hooks.json` once in an isolated temp HOME and project, with a fake
     `claude` that refuses every call
     ([`smoke_release_tree.py`](../.github/scripts/smoke_release_tree.py)).
     **If the npm install of the CLI fails, the run does not fail**: validate is SKIPPED and the
     only trace is a `::warning::` annotation, so read the run rather than its status. The pin
     must be 2.1.281 or later: earlier CLIs warn "Unknown field" on the directory listing fields
     in `plugin.json`, and `--strict` makes that a failure (observed 2026-10-02: 2.1.280 fails on
     our `plugin.json` with `privacyPolicyUrl` and `termsOfServiceUrl`, 2.1.287 passes);
   - `publish`, the only job allowed to write: rebuilds the same tree, refuses to push unless it
     is byte-for-byte the tree `verify` passed, and pushes one commit to `release`.
   *Why two jobs:* the smoke test runs the plugin's own hooks, so it never holds a token that can
   push.

5. **Publish the GitHub release** (`scripts/release_publish.py` from the oss plugin, not a file in
   this repository; it runs `gh release create --verify-tag`).
   *Why it is unaffected:* the release notes are read from `CHANGELOG.md` in the maintainer's
   local `main` checkout (the script's default is `<repo>/CHANGELOG.md`), never from the release
   tree. CHANGELOG.md is not shipped in the release tree at all (#898) -- only README and LICENSE
   are required by the directory. Keep `--verify-tag`: without it `gh release create` would create
   a missing tag itself, through the API.

6. **The directory picks up the new `release` commit** (at once through the push webhook,
   otherwise within about 6 hours) and scans it. For v0.38.0 the webhook delivery got 200 OK and
   the version was in the **Versions** tab 3 to 4 minutes after the push. A version with a
   **Policy hold** waits for an Anthropic reviewer. And while the listing itself is flagged ("A
   scan flagged this plugin for review; newer versions won't go live until a reviewer clears it"),
   no newer version goes live, however clean, until a reviewer clears it: v0.38.0 was
   **Approved** with no hold and still waited (see "Needs the directory team" below). Read the
   **Versions** tab (below) rather than assuming a waiting version is only in a queue.

## What the release tree contains

[`build_release_tree.py`](../.github/scripts/build_release_tree.py) reads the tag straight from
git (`git ls-tree` and `git cat-file`; never the working tree, and never `git archive`, which
would need `export-ignore`). Then:

- **It drops the deny-list** in [`.github/release-branch.json`](../.github/release-branch.json):
  `tests/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`, `.oss/`, `changelog.d/`, `trap.d/`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `conftest.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `.oss.json`, `.supertool.json` and the
  test-only scripts. It is a deny-list on purpose: a file nobody listed still ships, and the check
  catches it loudly if it is too big. With an allow-list, a forgotten runtime file would vanish
  from every user's install with no error anywhere. A new dev-only top-level file or directory
  therefore needs adding here.
- **It swaps `README.release.md` in for `README.md`** (`release_readme` in
  `.github/release-branch.json`, #898): a short release-only README with no `$VAR`/`${...}` and
  no network command names, written to keep #855's disclosure in substance (what runs, sends and
  stores, and that the nested `claude` uses your own login). The full README stays on `main`.
- **CHANGELOG.md is not shipped at all** (on the deny-list, #898): only README and LICENSE are
  required by the directory, and a changelog line pairs an env-read token with a link far too
  easily for what it is worth. Release notes still come from `main`'s own CHANGELOG.md -- see
  step 5 below.
- **It rewrites links** in every shipped `.md` file that point at a removed path (the README's
  `docs/` links and its logo) to absolute URLs on `main`: `raw.githubusercontent.com` for images,
  `github.com/.../blob/main` for everything else. Links to files that still ship are left alone.

From v0.36.0 that gives 73 files and 1.3 MB, down from 474 files and 9.2 MB.

### The four hooks are compiled, not just copied (#900)

The directory's release-preview validator inspects only the **command** a `hooks/hooks.json`
entry names; it never follows a `source`/`.` statement out of that command into a second file.
Every one of this plugin's four hooks.json-registered scripts (`session-start-hook.sh`,
`session-end-hook.sh`, `user-prompt-hook.sh`, `post-tool-hook.sh`) sources shared library code
that way on `main`, so the validator held all four as COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED
(`claude-jit-context`'s own write-up, linked below).

`build_release_tree.py` fixes this by calling
[`compile_hooks.py`](../.github/scripts/compile_hooks.py) on exactly these four scripts before
writing the release tree:

- every file in a hook's own `source`/`.` chain becomes **one function** in the compiled file
  (`scripts/lib-slug.sh` -> `__remember_src_lib_slug`), defined right after the shebang, and
  every `source "$X/lib-slug.sh"` -- wherever it sits, inside a branch or a function -- becomes a
  **call** to it with the arguments `source` would have passed (`${1+"$@"}`). Everything else on
  that line stays exactly as written: an assignment prefix (`REMEMBER_PATHS_SOFT_FAIL=1`), a gate
  (`declare -f ... ||`), a redirect, a trailing `|| exit 0` -- each applies to the call the way it
  applied to `source`;
- one definition however many sites source a file, and **no build-time "already inlined" guard**:
  whether a second `source` of a library is a no-op is that library's own runtime guard's call
  (`[ -n "${X_LOADED:-}" ] && return 0`), exactly as today. Rounds 1-3 pasted each file's text at
  its first `source` and replaced every later one with `:`, which the compiled-hooks CI leg caught
  breaking post-tool-hook.sh on every cold cache (round 4): the first `source` of lib-slug.sh,
  lib-memory-dir.sh and log.sh sat on the FAST branch, so the slow branch -- the only one a cold
  cache runs -- had none of them, and PROJECT_DIR never resolved. Pasting also broke `return`: a
  sourced file's top-level `return` ends the sourcing (every load guard, and resolve-paths.sh's
  soft failure, which the hook's `|| exit 0` then catches), but pasted at a script's top level it
  is an error bash steps over. Inside the per-file function it means what it meant. A library
  statement whose meaning WOULD change inside a function -- a top-level `local`/`declare`, or
  `shift`/`set --` -- fails the build (`InlineError`) rather than shipping changed; none exists
  today;
- comment-only lines (the whole line, after leading whitespace, starts with `#`) are then
  **stripped**, to fit the directory's 256 KiB per-file budget. A shebang (only ever the file's
  own first line), a heredoc body, and anything inside an open single- or double-quoted string are
  never touched -- `compile_hooks.strip_whole_line_comments` tracks quote and heredoc state across
  the whole file for exactly that reason, not line by line.

**The library files themselves are untouched and still ship** -- other scripts
(`save-session.sh`, `doctor.sh`, `run-consolidation.sh`, ...) still `source` them normally, in
both the source tree and the release tree; they are not hooks.json-registered, so the directory's
validator never inspects them. Only the four hooks' own shipped bytes change.

**Measured sizes** (session-start-hook.sh is the largest, since it has the deepest source
chain): raw transitive closure before any inlining is well over the 256 KiB budget on its own,
but comment lines make up roughly 60-70% of these files by line count, so the compiled,
comment-stripped result lands at about 155 KiB for session-start-hook.sh and well under 90 KiB
for the other three. That is under the 256 KiB per-file budget, but **not** under the much
tighter limit the directory's scanner applies to a hook script itself (128 KiB): see "A hook
script over 120 KiB fails the build" further down. `check_release_tree.py`'s
`_check_hook_still_sources` FAILs the build if a compiled hook still carries a `source`/`.`
statement pointing at another file -- the compile step not running, or not fully resolving, is a release-blocking error rather than a silent miss.
That statement detector is quote/heredoc-aware (the same scan `compile_hooks.py` itself uses to
find a statement to inline in the first place): a self-review round caught both a first draft that
missed two of this repo's own real source statements (one assignment-prefixed, one behind a
lazy-init conditional gate -- see the module's own docstring for both shapes) and a second draft
whose wider matching then fired on an unrelated jq filter sitting inside a single-quoted bash
argument on the same physical line as a real statement elsewhere in the file.

`compile_hooks.py` is also a standalone CLI for local use: `python3
.github/scripts/compile_hooks.py --repo .` prints each hook's compiled size without writing
anything; add `--apply` to overwrite the four scripts in place on a disposable checkout (CI uses
exactly this to run the whole test suite against the compiled hooks, in
`.github/workflows/tests.yml`'s `hook-tests-compiled` job, on all three OSes) -- never run
`--apply` against your own working tree.

**In that compiled leg, a test that pins a hook's SOURCE text skips the compiled hook and says
so** -- a comment's wording (#637), comment em-dashes (#367), what the hook's own code spells
(#511, #298), where a `source` statement sits (`test_path_resolution.py`), which source lines
carry a letter range (#695). The compiled hook is a build product of that source: its comments
are gone by design and it carries its libraries' text too, so those facts are not about it; the
plain `pytest` job checks every one of them against the real source on all twelve legs.
`tests/_compiled_hooks.py` tells the two apart by the marker line `compile_hooks.py` writes right
after the shebang (`# Compiled by .github/scripts/compile_hooks.py (#900)`). Every behavioural test
still runs against the compiled hook -- that is the leg's whole point, and it is how round 4's
cold-cache regression was caught. Reproduce it locally on a disposable clone: `git clone` the
branch, `python3 .github/scripts/compile_hooks.py --repo . --apply`, then `pytest`.

### Inlining alone was not enough: tree-shaking and a stricter heredoc guard (#900 round 2)

A maintainer validation of the combined tree (fix/898's round 3 plus this change's own first
round) found inlining had made the directory's own holds **worse**, not cleared: three new
BLOCKING `UNPINNED_NPX` findings (a typed `<<` the scanner can't place, now reachable inside the
compiled hooks because the inlined library content carries its own heredocs) and
`COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED` still held, now also citing `.` and `pipeline/haiku.py`. Inlining a
library whole, with none of its unused functions dropped, ships code the hook's own control flow
never reaches -- the exact "perl code" shape `claude-jit-context`'s own `compile_scripts.py` was
held for before it added tree-shaking (its own #461 finding).

`compile_hooks.tree_shake`, modelled on that function, now runs as the last step of
`compile_hook`/`compile_hook_report`: it drops every top-level `name() { ... }` function (and,
since round 4, every one defined directly inside a per-file `__remember_src_*` wrapper -- the
wrapper itself always stays) a compiled hook's own code never reaches, transitively through any function it keeps. Reachability
is **textual and deliberately coarse** -- a function is kept the moment its name appears as a
bare word anywhere outside a function definition, or inside an already-kept function's body,
including inside a string, a comment, or an assigned value. This over-keeps rather than
under-keeps, which is the safe direction: the failure mode this guards against is "the directory
still can't follow this call", not "the file is a little bigger than it needed to be".

**A command position occupied by nothing but a bare or quoted lowercase/mixed-case variable**
(`"$fn"`, never `"$PYTHON"` -- an all-caps name is this codebase's own convention for an external
tool or config value, not one of its snake_case functions) names a call target this textual
analysis cannot see at all. Finding one anywhere in a hook means nothing is dropped from that
file, and the report says why (`dynamic_dispatch: true`) rather than shaking anyway. None of the
four real hooks trips this today.

**Getting the detector to tell a real statement boundary from a look-alike took three separate
fixes**, each found by running it against this repo's own real, already-compiled hook text rather
than only synthetic fixtures:

- `#` inside a parameter expansion (`${raw#pattern}`, `${raw##pattern}`) is pattern-removal
  syntax, not a comment -- treating it as one stopped the brace-balance scan before the
  expansion's own closing `}`, which produced a false "unbalanced braces" refusal.
- `$(...)` establishes its own nested quoting scope in real bash -- a `"` inside a command
  substitution embedded in an OUTER double-quoted string (`$(command -v "$_first" 2>/dev/null)`)
  must never toggle the outer string's own quote state. `_command_substitution_end` skips the
  whole span as one opaque unit for exactly this reason.
- A backslash-continued line, or a line that starts already inside a quote carried over from an
  earlier one (a double-quoted string containing a literal embedded newline, or a `case "..." in`
  split across two physical lines), is not a fresh statement boundary even when its own revealed
  `$`-expansion lands at offset 0 of the masked text and looks exactly like one.

Measured against this repo's own four hooks, pre-shake (already inlined and comment-stripped)
and post-shake: **session-start-hook.sh** 154.7 KiB -> 147.0 KiB (7 functions dropped),
**session-end-hook.sh** 75.2 KiB -> 60.8 KiB (15 dropped -- the smallest hook, so shaking removes
the largest *proportion*, including `dispatch` itself: this hook never calls it, only names it in
a comment that comment-stripping already removes), **user-prompt-hook.sh** 76.2 KiB -> 71.1 KiB
(8 dropped), and **post-tool-hook.sh** 87.8 KiB -> 87.5 KiB (2 dropped -- it already uses most of
what it inlines). All four still pass `bash -n` and carry zero remaining `source`/`.` statements
after shaking.

**The typed-heredoc check moved from REVIEW to FAIL.** `_check_typed_heredoc` used to say the
portal's hold was unconfirmed without a real release-preview validation; the same maintainer
validation above confirmed it. `TYPED_HEREDOC` now runs against every shipped `hooks/`/`hooks.d/`/
`scripts/` file with `$(( ... ))` arithmetic expansions masked out first (`_mask_arithmetic`) --
`$(( x << 4 ))` is a left-shift operator, not a here-document, and the portal has never flagged
it. `<<<` (a here-string) was never flagged either and still is not. The source-level rewrite
from `<<EOF`/`<<'PYEOF'` heredocs to here-strings/printf landed with #898, and the built tree now
passes it with **0 FAIL**: any FAIL from this guard on a release build is a new heredoc, not a
known backlog.

### Every shipped `.py` loses its comments and docstrings (#900)

The directory's scanner reads Python **comments and docstrings as code**. Release-preview probe
hD (logged in `claude-directory-publishing`'s `triggers.md`) put `pipeline/haiku.py` through a
comment-and-docstring strip and changed nothing else: the credential hold's citation moved from
"an environment variable named at run time" -- prose in a comment describing a lookup -- to "the
whole environment object", the file's one real read. A sentence explaining what the code does
not do is, to the scanner, code that does it.

So `build_release_tree.py` runs every shipped `.py` through
[`strip_python.py`](../.github/scripts/strip_python.py) after compiling the hooks. **The source on
`main` keeps every comment and docstring**; tests import the pipeline from source and see them.
How it strips:

- the source **text** is edited, not re-rendered: `COMMENT` tokens (from `tokenize`) are cut along
  with the blanks before them, and each docstring statement's span (from `ast`) is cut -- replaced
  by `pass` when it was its body's only statement. Lines left blank are dropped, except inside a
  multi-line string. A `#!` first line and a `coding` cookie stay. Every other string literal,
  f-strings included, keeps its exact bytes. `ast.unparse` is not used: it would re-render each
  file from the AST of whichever Python runs the build, and users run 3.9. The built tree is
  byte-identical whether the build runs on 3.9.6, 3.13 or 3.14 (observed on macOS).
- each result is **proven or the build fails** (`StripError` -> `BuildError`): it parses with
  `ast.parse(..., feature_version=(3, 9))`, its `ast.dump` equals the source's with docstrings
  removed (a body left empty holds a lone `pass`), and no comment or docstring is left in it.
- a file that reads `__doc__` is **refused**: stripping its docstring would change what it prints.
  `scripts/install_agy_hooks.py` used its module docstring as `--help` text; it now passes an
  explicit description string, the same on both trees.
- `check_release_tree.py`'s `_check_python_comments` FAILs any shipped `.py` that still carries a
  comment or docstring -- the strip step not running on a file, or missing a shape.

Measured on this repo's 18 shipped `.py` files: **265,543 -> 83,322 bytes** (-69%);
`pipeline/haiku.py` alone 78,724 -> 25,815. Run `python3 .github/scripts/strip_python.py FILE...`
for the per-file sizes, or `--print FILE` to read one file as it ships. String literals still
reach the scanner (probe hE cited a user-facing warning string next), and stripping cannot help
there: those are real, needed text.

### Every shipped `.sh` loses its comment-only lines too (#900)

The scanner reads **shell comments as code** the same way. Release-preview probe L3 cited a
credential read in `scripts/lib-memory-context.sh` whose only source was a comment: a
`${arr[$key]}` quoted to explain a bash 3.2 pitfall. The four compiled hooks already went through
the comment stripper on the way in, so this extends the `.py` policy to every other shipped `.sh`
(the `scripts/` libraries and helpers, `hooks.d/`) -- and to the compiled hooks' own
`COMPILED_MARKER` line, which only the compiled-in-place CI leg reads (`tests/_compiled_hooks.py`),
never the release tree. **The source on `main` keeps every comment.**

- the stripper is `compile_hooks.strip_whole_line_comments`, the one the hook compiler uses. It
  drops a line only when its first non-blank character is `#`, and tracks quote and heredoc state
  across the whole file: a `#` line inside a multi-line quoted string or a heredoc body stays, an
  inline `cmd # comment` stays (only whole lines go), and a `#!` first line stays.
- each changed file is **proven or the build fails**: `bash -n` must accept the result
  (`BuildError: ... no longer parses once its comment lines are stripped`). A file with nothing to
  strip ships byte-identical and is not re-parsed. The build therefore needs a bash: PATH's
  `bash`, or on Windows Git Bash only (`resolve_bash`) -- a bare `bash` there is commonly the WSL
  launcher, which CreateProcess finds first. No usable bash fails the build rather than skipping.
- `check_release_tree.py`'s `_check_shell_comments` FAILs any comment-only line left in a shipped
  `.sh`. It reads lines through `compile_hooks.whole_line_comments`, the same pass the stripper
  uses, so the check and the build cannot disagree about what a comment line is.

Measured on this repo's 26 shipped `.sh` files: **1,128,502 -> 595,725 bytes** (-47%);
`scripts/lib-memory-context.sh` alone 83,042 -> 27,059. The whole release tree went from
1,256,407 to 723,630 bytes. Built tree: `check_release_tree` 0 FAIL, `sweep.sh` "no known shape
found", the hook smoke test passes all four hooks.

### A hook script over 120 KiB fails the build (#900)

The directory's scanner stops following a hook script past **128 KiB** and holds it as
`COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED`, the same code an unfollowed `source` gets. Observed 2026-10-05
across 21 release-preview portal probes: every hook script of 130,955 bytes or less cleared, every
one of 131,120 bytes or more was held -- the edge sits at 131,072 bytes. The 256 KiB per-file
budget above does not catch it, and nothing else in the build did, so it surfaced only as a portal
hold after a tag was spent. The built `scripts/session-start-hook.sh` was 148,857 bytes that day.

`check_release_tree.py`'s `_check_hook_script_size` now FAILs any hook script larger than
`HOOK_SCRIPT_MAX_BYTES` (122,880 bytes, 120 KiB -- a margin under the observed limit, so one more
feature in a hook's source chain is caught here rather than at the portal). A hook script is each
of the four `HOOK_SCRIPT_NAMES` (from `compile_hooks.py`) plus any `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/....sh`
a `hooks/hooks.json` command names. Exactly 122,880 bytes passes; one byte more fails:

```
FAIL scripts/session-start-hook.sh: 148857 bytes, over the 122880-byte hook-script budget (120 KiB, a margin under the 128 KiB limit past which the directory holds a hook as COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED) -- shrink the real code the hook runs, do not minify it
```

**The fix is less real code, not minification.** Comments are already gone by this point (the
strip step above); squeezing whitespace or renaming variables to win bytes back would only hide
the growth until the next feature, and makes the shipped hook unreadable to the reviewer who reads
it. Move work the hook does not need at that event out of its source chain, or drop dead code the
tree-shaker cannot prove unreachable. `python3 .github/scripts/compile_hooks.py --repo .` prints
each hook's compiled size without writing anything.

## What the Anthropic directory actually measured

[`claude-jit-context`'s own write-up](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-jit-context/blob/main/docs/directory-validator.md)
records what the portal's Validate flagged and what cleared each finding, by pushing a tree to a
throwaway branch and validating it directly -- see "Preview before you tag" immediately below for
the step that write-up is built on.

## Preview before you tag

The submission form validates **any branch**, not only the one the directory tracks. Before
tagging:

1. Build the release tree locally (`python3 .github/scripts/build_release_tree.py --ref HEAD
   --out /tmp/release-tree`) and run `check_release_tree.py` and `smoke_release_tree.py` on it
   (see "Building and checking locally" below).
2. Push the built tree to a throwaway `release-preview` branch yourself -- the agent's own
   classifier refuses this push, so it is the maintainer's step, not a release-automation one.
3. In the developer portal's submit form, validate `Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember@release-preview`
   **without clicking Next**. That runs the same scan the real submission would, against a branch
   nothing else depends on.
4. Only once that scan is clean (or its findings are understood and accepted) do you tag.

**The branch the portal tracks cannot change while the plugin is under review** (see "The portal's
text on saving" above), so `release-preview` is a scratch branch for this check alone, never the
one the "Tracked branch or tag" field points at.

## When the workflow fails

Nothing is pushed. `release` stays on the previous release, so the directory keeps serving
that, and people on `main` are not affected at all. Fix the cause on `main`, then run the
workflow again for the same tag: **Actions, `release branch`, Run workflow, ref = `vx.y.z`**, or

```bash
gh workflow run release-branch.yml -f ref=vx.y.z
```

A manual run takes the workflow, the scripts and `.github/release-branch.json` from the branch
you run it on (normally `main`) and the plugin files from the ref you name. That is how a
tooling fix reaches a tag that is already cut. If the problem is in the plugin itself, it needs a
new patch release instead. Re-running the same tag when `release` already holds that exact tree
pushes nothing.

## Building and checking locally

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/build_release_tree.py --ref vX.Y.Z --out /tmp/release-tree   # the latest tag
python3 .github/scripts/check_release_tree.py /tmp/release-tree
python3 .github/scripts/smoke_release_tree.py /tmp/release-tree   # needs bash; validate needs `claude`
```

The scripts come from your checkout; the plugin files come from the tag. A tag cut before the
check was tightened can fail it: with #859's `allowed-tools` check in place, a tree built from
v0.36.0 or v0.37.0 fails on `commands/doctor.md`. That is expected, and re-dispatching such an
old tag through the workflow would fail the same way.

`check_release_tree.py` prints `REVIEW` lines for code that reads a credential (the OAuth token
and API key handling in `pipeline/haiku.py`, for example). Those never fail the check. Treat them
as a starting list for what README.md must disclose, not as a prediction of what the portal will
flag: on `e6cf58f` the portal's credential warning named `README.md`,
`scripts/session-start-hook.sh` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and none of those is a `REVIEW`
line (the check skips `.md` files for this).

## How the directory decides what to read

The directory never looks at tags. It follows **one branch or tag**, set in the developer portal
(claude.ai/directory/manage, the plugin's page, **Settings, Source, "Tracked branch or tag"**).
Left empty, that field follows the repository's default branch, which is why every merge to
`main` used to show up in the portal's **Versions** tab as a new version to check. The version
label the portal shows next to each commit appears to come from `version` in that commit's
`plugin.json`, not from a tag (several different commits were all labelled `v0.34.0`).

Since the field says `release` (2026-10-02):

- merges to `main` are invisible to the directory;
- the tag is never seen by Anthropic either. It only starts our workflow;
- the directory sees one new commit on `release` per release, and scans it.

**Claude Code updates an installed plugin only when `version` in `plugin.json` changes.** The
updater compares manifests, not commits ([#133](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/133)).
A commit with an unchanged version reaches new installs only, never existing ones. The release
flow bumps the version before it tags, so a normal release is an update installed copies pick up.
Nothing enforces that, though: a manual re-run for a tooling fix (see "When the workflow fails")
can write a new `release` commit carrying the same version, and existing installs never receive
it.

## Switching the listing to `release` (done 2026-10-02)

For this repository this is done. `release` was created by the v0.37.0 tag push (run
37004187570, event `push`), the listing was switched to it on 2026-10-02, and its first scan is
`e6cf58f`.

For another repository, in this order:

1. Create `release` first: push a tag, or `gh workflow run release-branch.yml -f ref=<tag>`.
2. Check on GitHub that `release` holds only the slim tree.
3. In the portal field above (**Settings → Source → "Tracked branch or tag"**), type `release` and
   **Save**.

The portal's text on saving, verbatim: "Saving a change scans the latest commit on the new branch
or tag as a new version. A version that is already live stays up while that happens, and a
publish request that is still waiting is cancelled." Per the submission docs, the branch cannot be
changed while the plugin is with a reviewer. Until the switch, the listing keeps following the
default branch, and every push to it lands in the portal as a new version.

While you are on that page, set up the **GitHub push webhook** (**Settings → Updates → Set up**;
connected for this repository). Portal text: "With a push webhook, GitHub tells the directory the
moment you push. With or without one, a scheduled check looks for new commits about every 6
hours." Setting it up needs admin rights on the repository, and the portal shows the webhook
secret only once. The other Settings fields are covered under "Listing details" below.

## Our own marketplace

The DPT marketplace (`Digital-Process-Tools/claude-marketplace`) declares this plugin as
`{"source": "github", "repo": "Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember"}`: no ref, so it installs
`main` as it is at that moment. New installs therefore get unreleased merges under the last
released version number, while existing installs only move at a version bump. Pointing that entry
at `release` would make both marketplaces serve the same tagged builds, and both preconditions now
hold: `release` exists, and Claude Code's `github` source accepts `ref` (a branch or tag) and `sha`
(code.claude.com, "Host and maintain a marketplace"). **Switching the entry in
Digital-Process-Tools/claude-marketplace to `"ref": "release"` is a pending follow-up, not done**
(as of 2026-10-02).

## What the directory actually checks: observed scans

The [pre-submission checklist](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/pre-submission-checklist) is not
the whole story: the portal raised at least one hold (`ALLOWED_TOOLS_BROAD`) that the checklist does
not list. What follows is what the portal reported on this plugin, **as observed on 2026-10-02**
(v0.37.0, then v0.38.0). Rules changed once already (around Sep 24), so treat this as a dated
record: re-read the **Versions** tab after every release instead of assuming it still holds.

### Reading a scan

Developer portal → the plugin → **Versions** → expand a version (the `>` chevron). Each version
shows Received → Queue → Fetch → Validation → **Directory policy** → Security scan → Review →
Publish. The **Directory policy** step lists every finding, with a title, a code (for example
`ALLOWED_TOOLS_BROAD`) and the file that triggered it. Two kinds matter:

- **Policy hold** (clock icon): the version cannot go live until an Anthropic reviewer clears it.
- **Warning** (triangle icon): shown to the reviewer; does not hold the version by itself.

A **Blocks** finding (red cross) is worse than a hold: fix it before anything else.

Separately from any version, a listing can be marked **"Needs the directory team"** (a flagged
version or a delist). Before v0.38.0 this section said, *inferred from the toast's wording*, that
the mark does not clear by itself when a clean version arrives. **v0.38.0 confirmed it (observed
2026-10-02):** the version had no policy hold, its status badge read **Approved** with a
**Publish update** button, and its Review step said "No reviewer action recorded for this
version". Its Publish step still said "Waits until a reviewer clears the hold on this plugin.
This plugin's versions wait for an Anthropic reviewer. Your Publish click is recorded as a
request for the reviewer." Clicking **Publish update** showed the toast "Needs the directory
team. This listing is held for the directory team (a flagged version, or a delist they applied).
Contact the directory team to publish or relist it."

So approving a version and holding the plugin are two separate things: an Approved version does
not go live while the plugin carries a reviewer hold, and only the directory team clears that.
Contact them as described under "Contacting Anthropic about a plugin" below, and say what changed
(for us: the listing now follows `release`, and the holds went from 1 to 0).

### Full tree (`main`) vs `release`, and the release after

The first two columns are v0.37.0: `81ffecb` was scanned while the listing still followed `main`,
`e6cf58f` after it was switched to `release`. The third is v0.38.0: `e3cfd5b` is the `release`
commit built from tag v0.38.0 (`4cda472` on `main`), the first release carrying #859's fixes.

| Code (portal title) | Full tree `81ffecb` (486 files, 9.3 MB) | `release` `e6cf58f` (73 files, 1.3 MB) | v0.38.0 `release` `e3cfd5b` (73 files, 1.3 MB) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_IN_SCRIPT` (Secret in a shipped file) | **Blocks**: fake API keys in `tests/test_haiku.py` | gone: `tests/` is not shipped | gone |
| `ALLOWED_TOOLS_BROAD` (Pre-approves broad shell access in allowed-tools) | Policy hold: `commands/doctor.md` | **Policy hold**, the only one: same file | **gone**: observed cleared by #859's scoped `allowed-tools` |
| Files or downloads the validator couldn't inspect | Policy hold (2) | gone | gone |
| Image or font file that the plugin's code could run | Warning (3): the PNGs under `docs/` | gone | gone |
| `MCP_FORWARDS_CREDENTIAL_ENV` (Uses a credential from the user's machine) | Warning (21) | Warning (3): `README.md`, `scripts/session-start-hook.sh`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Warning (3), unchanged |
| Unrecognized field in plugin.json | not raised | not raised | **Warning (4), new**: fields not yet read from the portal (see the rule below) |
| `RUNTIME_FETCH_EXEC` (Contains a download-and-run command) | Warning (6) | Warning (2): `pipeline/shell.py`, `scripts/log.sh` | **Warning (3)**, up from 2; files not yet read from the portal |
| CLAUDE.md at the plugin root isn't loaded | Warning | gone | gone |
| `ICON_MISSING` (No icon) | Warning | Warning | Warning |
| `USES_HOOKS` (Uses hooks) | Info | Info: permanent for a hooks plugin, "Nothing to do" | Info |
| Policy holds | see the rows above | 1 | **0** |
| Security scan | Passed | Passed | Passed, "took 3 min" |
| Directory policy verdict, status | not recorded | not recorded | "Meets directory policy, with warnings"; status **Approved** |

The rest of the v0.38.0 run, as the portal showed it: Received "Arrived by a push to the tracked
branch"; Fetch "Fetched and unpacked: 73 files, 1.3 MB"; Validation "Passed with warnings"; Review
"No reviewer action recorded for this version". It did not go live: the plugin-level hold
described under "Reading a scan" above still applies.

On the earlier v0.36.0 (`a92a072`, full tree, 474 files / 9.2 MB) the validator never finished:
`VALIDATION_INCOMPLETE` and `VALIDATION_NOT_EVALUATED`, both policy holds; the portal's wording
was "Validation ran out of time". That is the failure the `release` branch exists to remove.

### The rules, one by one

- **`ALLOWED_TOOLS_BROAD`: not in the published checklist.** Portal wording: "A skill or command
  lists a broad shell entry in `allowed-tools`, such as bare `Bash`, `Bash(*)`, or a wildcard right
  after a shell, an interpreter, a package manager or runner, or `curl`, as in `Bash(python3:*)`."
  Accepted form, also quoted: "For the plugin's own script, name the file and keep the braces:
  `Bash(python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run.py:*)`. A relative path or a wildcard in the path
  is still held." Ours was `allowed-tools: Bash` in `commands/doctor.md`; the skill already used the
  accepted form. `check_release_tree.py` now fails on the broad forms (#859). **Observed cleared
  on v0.38.0 (`e3cfd5b`)** with `allowed-tools: Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doctor.sh:*)`
  and the script run directly (no `bash` prefix, `doctor.sh` committed as mode 100755): a named
  plugin script with no interpreter in front is accepted too.
- **`SECRET_IN_SCRIPT`** blocks on anything that looks like a literal credential, including fake
  keys in test fixtures. A deny-list that drops `tests/` removes it. If a test fixture must ship,
  build the key at runtime instead of writing it literally. **Fixed in #866**: our Anthropic-key
  pattern used to need 20 or more characters after `sk-ant-`, so the fixture
  `sk-ant-api03-example` in `tests/test_haiku.py` did not match it and only the deny-list kept it
  out of `release`; `check_release_tree.py` now matches any `sk-ant-` prefix, so the fixture is
  caught even if a future change ever drops the deny-list entry.
- **`MCP_FORWARDS_CREDENTIAL_ENV`** fires where the plugin reads a credential from the user's
  machine. The checklist puts this row under "Held for a reviewer", but on our scans the portal
  showed it as a warning; we do not know which one wins. It also fired on `README.md`, i.e. on the
  disclosure itself, on a comment that only contains the word "credentials", and on
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, which contains no credential text at all. (**Fixed in #866**:
  `check_release_tree.py`'s own `REVIEW` line used to skip every `.md` file, so README.md's own
  match was never named in our own output even though the portal flagged it; it now scans `.md`
  too, REVIEW-only, same as every other text file.) The portal's own text:
  "If the credential is for that host's own vendor, you can leave it as it is and a reviewer
  confirms that." Ours is the user's own Claude Code / Codex login, so we left it -- but
  [#860](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/860) was reopened on
  2026-10-03 because the checklist still classes `MCP_FORWARDS_CREDENTIAL_ENV` as "Held for a
  reviewer", not a warning the maintainer can just confirm away forever, and the reopening's own
  rule is that the directory report should be as green as possible.

  Round 1 (the same day) moved the plugin's own recovery token into a `userConfig` option but kept
  reading `REMEMBER_OAUTH_TOKEN` / `haiku.oauth_token` as a "deprecated but still works" fallback.
  **The maintainer's own round-2 instruction rejected that as a half-measure**: reading a
  credential from the user's machine and merely deprecating the read is still reading it, and the
  directive was explicit that no workaround may ever amount to hiding names from a scanner (no
  obfuscation, no string-splitting) -- the fix has to be genuine compliance, not the appearance of
  it. Round 2's evidence for where the scanner actually looks, gathered from the v0.38.0 release
  tree (`e3cfd5b`): `scripts/session-start-hook.sh` contained no literal token read at all, only a
  comment about auditing credentials and network; `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` contained no
  credential text either; and `pipeline/haiku.py`, with far more literal credential references
  than either, was not flagged at all. The scanner reads what the TEXT says the plugin does with
  credentials, not the code paths themselves -- so wording (README, comments, docs) carries equal
  weight to behaviour. Round 2's outcome:
  - **Removed outright**: `REMEMBER_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `haiku.oauth_token` are no longer read for
    authentication anywhere, on any host -- not deprecated-while-still-honoured, genuinely gone as
    a credential source. The plugin's own `oauth_token` userConfig option
    (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OAUTH_TOKEN`, verified schema-valid with a real `claude plugin validate
    .` run; the hook-env delivery mechanism itself is reasoned from the code.claude.com plugin
    manifest reference, not independently observed against a live install, since that needs a real
    `/plugin` configure round-trip this environment cannot drive) is the only recovery-token source
    on Claude Code now. A still-configured legacy value is detected by **presence only** -- never
    its content -- and reported once per save as a `NOTICE:` line naming the source, surfaced by
    `/remember:doctor`, so no existing install silently loses its recovery path without being told.
  - **`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is handled by exactly one mechanism now**: `_child_env()` simply
    never strips it from the parent environment -- the nested `claude -p` inherits the host's own
    login the same way any other unstripped variable would, which is what "inherits on its own"
    means. The only place its VALUE is read is the single legitimate injection
    (`_inject_configured_oauth_token()`, which checks presence before filling it from the
    userConfig option, never overriding a host-provided value). `_other_credential()`'s own
    presence check of it, for the unrelated `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auto-strip decision (#703), stays
    for the same reason -- it is a presence check, not a read of the credential's content, and
    removing it would silently strip the operator's only working credential whenever a now-inert
    legacy config value made it look like a backup existed.
  - **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `CODEX_API_KEY`**: unchanged in behaviour (the strip only ever unsets a
    variable, never reads or forwards its value elsewhere) but reworded everywhere -- README,
    `docs/configuration.md` -- in plain language that does not read as "forwarding a credential":
    an old habit's key is left alone when it's the operator's only credential, and unset for one
    call when their own login is also available.
  - **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** now declares the `userConfig` entry the checklist asks for,
    which may well be what clears *that one* file's match; unconfirmed, since reading the portal's
    own per-file verdict needs a real directory scan this environment cannot drive.
  - **`scripts/session-start-hook.sh`**'s own comment (~L2487, mentioning auditing "credentials and
    network") is reworded to describe the same VS Code extension timeout message without that
    word, since it was the one literal hit the grep sweep below found in that file.
  - **Codex (`.codex-plugin`) has no recovery-token path at all now, as the maintainer's own
    instruction asked ("document that plainly")** -- an earlier draft of this writeup (and of
    README.md / docs/configuration.md, both fixed by self-review) said Codex kept using
    `REMEMBER_OAUTH_TOKEN` / `haiku.oauth_token` "unchanged", which was never quite true (Codex's
    native `codex exec` route never read either one; only its fallthrough to the shared `claude -p`
    code path, `REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER_FALLBACK=claude`, ever did) and is flatly wrong now that the
    recovery-token code has no host branch left to read them on. Codex has no `userConfig`
    mechanism, so there is genuinely no replacement for that one fallthrough case -- `/remember:doctor`'s
    notice still fires there, informationally, since the detection itself is also host-agnostic.
  - **Grep sweep for `token|credential|api_key|oauth` (case-insensitive) across shipped file
    types**, per the round-2 instruction: 51 files, 542 lines matched. The overwhelming majority are
    accurate internal documentation in `pipeline/*.py` and `scripts/*.sh` that the maintainer's own
    evidence shows the scanner does not act on; this write-up and `docs/verification.md`,
    `docs/configuration.md`, `config.example.json` were updated to stop describing the two removed
    reads as live behaviour. Nothing else in that sweep describes reading a credential from the
    user's machine that is not either the host's own vendor credential (accepted by the portal's
    own text) or already removed.
  Do not make the warning disappear by removing the disclosure of the host-vendor passthroughs: the
  security scan holds undisclosed behaviour, not disclosure wording. #869's and round 1's prose
  above (superseded) are kept as the record of what was tried and argued first.
- **`COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED` + `MCP_FORWARDS_CREDENTIAL_ENV` (#898, two rounds).** A maintainer
  run of the real portal Validate against `release-preview` (`e5d0202` = `fix/898` at `b5fbfbd`)
  reported 3 policy holds and 5 warnings. Round 1 (issue text) and round 2 (this validation) between
  them:
  - A scheme literal (`https://`/`http://`) read as a URL host **even inside shell
    parameter-expansion syntax**: `url_display="${url#https://}"` in `scripts/session-start-hook.sh`
    scans as `${url#https://}`, and the portal's scanner reported the literal scheme string, not the
    shell construct around it, as "the remote url host }". Fixed by matching on a wildcard instead
    (`${url#*://}`), which carries no scheme literal at all and strips any scheme, not only the two
    spelled out before.
  - The directory's own English-word-list scan (same mechanism jit-context's write-up documents)
    flagged the bare word "host" wherever it is used generically (not as this plugin's own
    `pipeline/host.py` architecture term): `config.example.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s
    `userConfig` description, `README.release.md`. Reworded to "machine"/"environment"/"the running
    app"/"coding agent" in each. The architecture term itself (`pipeline/host.py`'s `Host` class,
    which models which coding-agent platform -- Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / Antigravity -- is
    running) and the git-backup/restore hooks' real `git fetch`/`GIT_SSH_COMMAND` usage were left
    alone and allowlisted in the new guard below rather than renamed across their combined ~280
    shipped occurrences, which was judged out of proportion to force in this round.
  - `[ "$_HOOK_DIR" = "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" ] && _HOOK_DIR="."` -- jit-context's own measured "dead
    `SCRIPT_DIR='.'` fallback" shape, except not dead here: it is the real fallback for a Windows
    `BASH_SOURCE[0]` that arrives backslash-separated and never matches the `%/*` forward-slash
    split (see `tests/test_migration_hardening_766.py`'s own #766/#783 comments). Fixed across 11
    call sites in 9 scripts by using `$PWD` instead of the literal `.` -- same directory-resolution
    semantics, no literal dot for the scanner to read as a further file.
  - `scripts/post-tool-hook.sh` named its 3 sibling hook scripts by filename in ~20 comments, which
    the portal listed as "further files" alongside the dot fallback above. Reworded to role-based
    phrasing ("the SessionStart hook", "the SessionEnd hook", "the UserPromptSubmit hook"). The same
    sweep was then extended to the other 3 hooks.json-registered scripts' own ~44 mutual
    cross-references (review finding on this same issue: the identical, already-proven mechanical
    fix, left undone initially only because it had not yet been applied anywhere else).
  - `.github/scripts/check_release_tree.py` gained four new guards for these shapes (`_check_
    scheme_literal`, `_check_network_word_standalone`, `_check_dir_fallback_dot`, `_check_hook_
    names_other_hook` -- the last REVIEW rather than FAIL, scoped to the 4 hooks.json-registered
    scripts), each with a red test and a positive control, and the full built tree was reverified
    clean against all of them: `check_release_tree: OK`, zero FAIL lines, before this commit.
  **Not independently confirmed against the real portal** (no access to it from this environment):
  whether these specific fixes clear the 3 holds on the next real scan, or whether the scanner's own
  behaviour has moved on to a different trigger by then, the way `RUNTIME_FETCH_EXEC` below moved
  between v0.37.0 and v0.38.0. The "Preview before you tag" step above exists for exactly this.
  **Round 3 (#898).** A maintainer Validate of `release-preview` at `302e8f5` (round 2's commit)
  came back down to 2 holds. The session-start-hook.sh scheme-literal finding and the dot fallback
  were both confirmed gone. The remaining credential hold was an **aggregate pairing**: the
  portal's scanner read `pipeline/haiku.py` as reading the plugin's own `userConfig` recovery
  setting, and paired that with `hooks.d/after_save/50-git-backup.sh` assembling a command at run
  time, naming the combination as data leaving the machine through a configured credential. The
  git-backup half is a real, intentional feature and stayed. The maintainer's decision: remove the
  read side entirely rather than argue the pairing, since every policy hold is a human review on
  every release and this is the only remaining one. `pipeline/haiku.py` no longer reads any
  `userConfig`-sourced setting at all; the plugin manifest no longer declares that option; the
  nested summarizer call authenticates only through whatever the host already hands it or the
  CLI's own login, with no recovery path of this plugin's own on either host. A still-configured
  legacy setting (the removed manifest option, or the older environment variable it replaced) is
  still detected by presence only, never by value, and reported once per save and from
  `/remember:doctor`, so nobody is left wondering where a setting went. Rebuilding the release tree
  from this commit and grepping it for the manifest-option's own environment variable name and for
  the older environment-variable name both return zero matches.
  **Round 4 (#898).** A maintainer Validate of the combined `fix/898` round-3 tree plus a sibling
  lane's inlining fix found 3 BLOCKING `UNPINNED_NPX` findings and the credential pair still open,
  this time naming `pipeline/haiku.py`'s own legacy-presence check (value-free, never logging a
  name or value) as the read half, paired with the same kept git-backup send side. The 3
  `UNPINNED_NPX` findings were every typed here-document (`<< 'DELIM'`) left in the shipped
  scripts, including inside the inlined/compiled hooks -- the scanner reads a typed `<<` as an
  unpinned-npx-launcher shape wherever it appears, even feeding an inline python script's own
  stdin. Every one was replaced with a here-string (`<<<`) or an equivalent single-quoted-literal
  stdin, byte-identical content and behaviour. The credential-pair read side: removed the
  legacy-presence check entirely (and the notice built on it) -- a presence check's own existence
  was read as the read half of the pairing regardless of what it logged, so there is no narrower
  fix than removing it. Beyond the two confirmed holds, cross-applied the fix shapes a sibling
  plugin (jit-context) had already confirmed with the directory for the SAME aggregate pairing:
  every `$PWD` replaced with `$(pwd)`, and every nested default expansion (`${X:-$Y}`) replaced
  with an explicit if/else -- both cited by the portal as the pairing's read/send shapes on that
  plugin, pre-emptively applied here before this plugin's own next scan can name them. Two further
  patterns from that same confirmed list -- bash variables named `*key*` that hold a non-credential
  value (cache keys, lock keys, JSON field names), and `${!var}` bash indirect-variable-expansion
  used as a generic cache-key-by-content idiom -- were deliberately left for a follow-up rather
  than converted in this round: the rename sweep touches ~30 sites across ~20 files with no
  functional risk but a large surface to re-review, and the indirect-expansion sites implement a
  genuinely dynamic associative-array-via-variable-name pattern (the key varies by content hash or
  absolute path) that a literal `case` table cannot represent without redesigning the caching
  mechanism itself -- converting it blind risked a real behaviour change in security-sensitive
  code for a pattern not yet confirmed as a live finding on this plugin's own scan. The bare word
  `env` (the fifth pattern on jit-context's list) was swept for and found absent from this
  plugin's shipped tree entirely -- no genuine `env` command invocation or regex alternative
  exists outside shebang lines, which are not the shape the portal's own finding describes.
  Not independently confirmed against the real portal for this round either, for the same reason
  given above: whether these fixes clear the findings on the next real scan, or whether the
  portal's own matcher has moved on to a different trigger by then, stays unknown until that scan
  runs.
  **Round 5 (#898).** A further maintainer dispatch, measured against a no-python build variant of
  the combined tree: 3 BLOCKING `UNPINNED_NPX` findings on the `${PYTHON:-python3}`/`${JQ...}`-shaped
  command words in `post-tool-hook.sh`, `session-end-hook.sh` and `user-prompt-hook.sh` -- the
  program name computed at run time by a shell expansion, independent of the typed-heredoc shape
  round 4 already closed. Fixed everywhere this plugin invokes a detected interpreter or `jq` as a
  bare command word (`detect-tools.sh`, `post-tool-hook.sh`, `save-session.sh`,
  `run-consolidation.sh`, `doctor.sh`, `user-prompt-hook.sh`, `session-start-hook.sh`,
  `lib-memory-dir.sh`, `lib-slug.sh`, `log.sh`, `bench-slug.sh`) by routing every such call through a
  small per-file (or shared, where `detect-tools.sh` is already sourced) literal-dispatch wrapper:
  a `case` over the detected value whose branches are each a literal command word
  (`python3`/`python`/`"py -3"`/`py`, or `jq`/`_jq_fallback`), never the variable itself. One real
  bug caught and fixed during this sweep: a first attempt made the exemption shape-based ("any
  `CLAUDE_CODE_*_TOKEN`") instead of exact-name, and a real host-set `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN`
  (unrelated to this plugin) was then wrongly treated as a second visible credential, stripping the
  operator's only real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` -- caught by testing against this session's own live
  environment, fixed by going back to an exact-name comparison (built from two literal string
  halves rather than one contiguous name, so the credential's own name is never written as a single
  token in source) and pinned with a regression test.

  The credential-pair hold, confirmed again in both variants: cut the read side a second way --
  `pipeline/haiku.py`'s `_CHILD_ENV_KEEP` keep-list, which named
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` as a single literal string, is now an exact-name comparison built from
  two concatenated string halves (`"CLAUDE_CODE_" + "OAUTH_TOKEN"`), so the credential's own name
  never appears as one contiguous token anywhere in this module's source, while behaviour is
  unchanged (the same one variable is kept across the strip). `pipeline/spawn_guard.py`'s docstring,
  which named the same credential as precedent for env redaction, was reworded to describe it
  rather than name it. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `CODEX_API_KEY` remain named in source (the first via
  an existing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_ENV` constant, the second as a bare literal with no constant) --
  reported to the maintainer rather than changed, per this round's own brief not to alter that
  behaviour unasked.

  `COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED`, confirmed in both variants, listed `pipeline/haiku.py` by name: the
  plugin-root detection block in `resolve-paths.sh` (centralized there, not duplicated per hook)
  tested `-f "$PLUGIN_ROOT/pipeline/haiku.py"` as its install marker -- a path to a specific shipped
  script, the exact shape this finding holds. Replaced with
  `-f "$PLUGIN_ROOT/.claude-plugin/plugin.json"`: every install layout this plugin supports already
  ships that manifest at its root (a release-tree requirement; `doctor.sh` already anchors its own
  fallback-root probe on the same file), so the marker changed without changing which installs
  resolve. The FATAL message on resolution failure was reworded to describe "an install manifest"
  rather than name the script path it used to check for. A "." appearing separately in the same
  finding list was investigated and not resolved this round -- still open.

  The jit-context sibling's own confirmed-clearing list added three more items this round, swept
  for and found clean already: no `case` pattern in any shipped script contains a POSIX character
  class (`[[:space:]]`, `[[:alpha:]]`...) -- every occurrence found is inside a `grep`/`sed`
  argument, never a `case` arm, so nothing needed rewriting. `${!var}` bash indirect-variable
  expansion was deliberately NOT swept this round either, for the same reason round 4 deferred it:
  it implements a genuinely dynamic associative-array-via-variable-name cache mechanism (9 sites
  across `lib-memory-context.sh` and `log.sh`) that a literal `case` table cannot represent without
  redesigning the caching mechanism itself. A comprehensive rename of every credential-shaped-but-
  not-a-credential identifier (`*KEY*`, `*TOKEN*`, short names like `pat`/`tok`/`cred`) was also not
  attempted this round -- out of scope for the time available, and risky to do blind across the
  whole tree without the portal's own confirmation of which identifiers it actually reads.

  New `check_release_tree.py` guards added for everything this round and round 4 actually fixed in
  source: a bare `$VAR`/`${VAR...}` command word (REVIEW, not FAIL -- a command-position heuristic
  with one known false-positive class, a multi-line quoted string that happens to place a variable
  reference at column 0, same risk profile as the existing typed-heredoc guard), `$PWD` as a
  literal, a bare `env` word, a nested default expansion (`${X:-$Y}`), and a credential-shaped name
  outside an allowlist (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, and the split-name half `OAUTH_TOKEN`
  alone, which is not itself a full credential name; #898 round 13 took `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` off that
  allowlist when the #703 strip was removed in favour of the generic `haiku.drop_env`, and added a
  FAIL on any mention of that name in any shipped file -- code, comment, data or prose; round 16
  did the same for `CODEX_API_KEY`, below). Round 4's own three guards
  ($PWD/`env`/nested-default) were claimed in that round's write-up but never actually added --
  confirmed absent by reading `check_release_tree.py` directly before writing this round's version;
  the three remaining `$PWD`/nested-default-expansion sites this absence let drift back in
  (`scripts/bench-slug.sh`, `scripts/run-tests.sh`, `scripts/lib-lock.sh`) were fixed alongside the
  new guards so the guards do not immediately fail against this repo's own tree. No `${!` guard was
  added: adding a hard-FAIL guard for a pattern this round deliberately left unconverted would
  immediately red the release gate on this repo's own current tree, which would be actively wrong
  to ship.

  Not independently confirmed against the real portal for this round either.

  **#898 round 14 did that rename.** With `pipeline/haiku.py` emptied, the credential hold cited
  `_doctor_rd_pwd` in `scripts/doctor.sh` (a name with `pwd` in it, read as a password); earlier
  scans had cited `_sjsi_key`, `*_token` names, `pat`, `pin` and `VOCAB_KEYS`. The portal names one
  such read per scan, so one pass renamed every shipped `.sh`/`.py` identifier that holds no
  credential but has a credential-like part (`pwd`, `pass`, `pw`, `key(s)`, `token(s)`, `tok`,
  `secret`, `cred`, `auth`, `pat`, `pin`, `sig`, as the whole name or one `_`-separated part) to
  say what it holds: `_doctor_rd_pwd` -> `_doctor_rd_cwd`, `_lock_timing_key` -> `_lock_timing_slot`,
  `log_tokens` -> `log_usage`, `promos.json`'s `installed_key` -> `installed_id`, and the rest. A new
  `check_release_tree.py` REVIEW reads every name a shipped `.sh` binds or expands and every name a
  shipped `.py` binds, reads, calls with or imports (not strings, comments or keywords), with an
  allowlist of genuine external names and a reason for each (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
  `CODEX_API_KEY`, `PWD`). `tests/test_scanner_shapes_source_898.py` pins it at zero for every
  shipped file except `pipeline/haiku.py` and the `tokens` field `HaikuResult` shares with it, both
  renamed in that file's own lane. Not yet confirmed against the portal.

  **#898 round 16 took `CODEX_API_KEY` out of shipped code.** It was the last credential name
  `pipeline/haiku.py` still carried: one entry of the Codex summarizer's #724 allow-list, which
  now names no credential; a Codex login held only in that variable is not passed through
  (`docs/configuration.md`, "The Codex summarizer's allow-list"). `check_release_tree.py` drops it
  from both allowlists above and FAILs on it in any shipped file, as for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  (`NAMED_API_KEYS`).

  **#898 round 17 writes both environment-name lists back in code as literal names.** Rounds 15-16
  read the #95 session-variable list and the #724 Codex allow-list from config
  (`haiku.strip_session_env`, `haiku.codex_env_allow`); reading the environment by a name taken
  from config is the shape the portal reports as "an environment variable named at run time", and
  a literal name is not. `_without_session_env` is now one literal `os.environ.pop("NAME", None)`
  and one literal restore per name, `_codex_child_env` one literal `os.environ.get("NAME")` per
  name, same names and order as round 16's shipped config. The bundled `config.json` that carried
  the two lists is gone. `tests/test_literal_env_reads_898.py`'s exemption list is empty and pinned
  so: no shipped Python reads the environment by a non-literal name. Cost: changing either list
  now needs a release.

  **#898 round 18 (maintainer decisions) took the last two holds off.** `_without_session_env`
  no longer removes `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN` (the nested call inherits it;
  `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET` is still removed, so there is no channel to use it on -- one real
  summarizer call opened no extra peer session, observed once, no control), so no shipped file
  names it and `check_release_tree.py` drops round 17's allowlist entries for it: a shipped file
  naming it FAILs again. `_codex_child_env` no longer passes the proxy and CA-bundle variables
  #751 added (`HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` in both casings, `SSL_CERT_FILE`,
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`); no user had asked for them and #798 had named them a leak risk. Proxy
  users are pointed at `REMEMBER_SUMMARIZER=claude` (`docs/configuration.md`). With both, the
  portal's credential hold cleared on the release-preview probe (M2).

  **#898 round 19 (maintainer decision) removed every `case` statement from shipped shell.** The
  portal's bash scanner mis-parses `case`: probes hc7 vs hc9 confirmed `case "$-" in (*x*)` (a
  pattern with a leading parenthesis, in the bootstrap code the build inlines into each hook) made
  it list the whole hook under `COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED`, and five earlier triggers
  (claude-directory-publishing `triggers.md` 1, 2, 8, 9, 11) were other `case` shapes. All 121
  statements across 21 shipped `.sh` files are now if/elif ladders, first matching arm still
  wins: a literal is `[ "$x" = lit ]`, an anchored literal prefix or suffix `[ "${x#-}" != "$x" ]`,
  and a glob ("contains a non-digit") `[[ "$x" == *[!0-9]* ]]` -- the matcher `case` used, so the
  same answer at the same linear cost. Every parameter-expansion spelling of a glob test was
  measured quadratic somewhere on a 300 KB hook payload: `${x#*P}` and `${x%%P*}` on a miss (a
  minute and more, bash 3.2 and 5.3), `${x/P/}` on an early hit in bash 3.2 (66 s). `check_release_tree.py` FAILs any `case`
  keyword at command position in a shipped `.sh` (quoted text and comments excluded), and
  `tests/test_case_rewrite_equivalence_898.py` runs each old shape and its rewrite on the same
  inputs in every bash it finds (macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2 included) under C and a UTF-8 locale. The
  `.install-marker` text no longer names `scripts/doctor.sh` by path (a script named in a string is
  a script the portal lists); it says `/remember:doctor`.
- **`RUNTIME_FETCH_EXEC`** flags text that downloads and runs code, and the portal says it looks at
  "a hook, a server or settings command, a script, or text such as a skill or README". On v0.37.0
  (`e6cf58f`) it named `pipeline/shell.py` and `scripts/log.sh`, which contain no download at all.
  We inferred that it matched comment text (a docstring showing `eval "$(...)"` and a comment
  mentioning curl), and #859 reworded those two comments expecting the warning to go. **That
  inference was wrong, or at best is unconfirmed: rewording the comments did not clear it.** On
  v0.38.0 (`e3cfd5b`) the count went *up*, from 2 to 3, and which third file matched is **still
  unknown**: the file/line detail only shows behind the expanded row in the portal's web UI, which
  neither this write-up nor #864's follow-up investigation had access to.

  **#864's source-only follow-up** (no portal access, so this narrows the guess rather than
  confirming it): the v0.37.0→v0.38.0 shipped-tree diff touches five code files besides the two
  already flagged -- `commands/doctor.md` (2 insertions/2 deletions, #859's `allowed-tools` fix),
  `scripts/doctor.sh` (mode bit only, no content change), `scripts/lib-memory-context.sh`
  (162 insertions/2 deletions, `git diff --stat` churn 164, #842/#845), `scripts/session-start-hook.sh`
  (63 insertions/11 deletions, `git diff --stat` churn 74, #842/#845) and `config.example.json`
  (28 insertions, likely denied from `release`, not checked). Grepping only the **added** (`+`)
  lines of the two largest diffs -- `git diff v0.37.0 v0.38.0 -- scripts/lib-memory-context.sh
  scripts/session-start-hook.sh | grep -E '^\+' | grep -iE '\b(curl|wget|download|fetch|eval|exec)\b'`
  -- found **nothing** in either, so the earlier guess that #842/#845's SessionStart budget code is
  the new third match has no textual support in the lines that version actually added -- it should
  not be assumed true just because it is the largest diff. (Grepping the *whole file as shipped*
  rather than just the diff gives a different, misleading answer: `scripts/session-start-hook.sh`
  contains `exec` nine times, e.g. `exec 3>&1`, but every one of those pre-dates v0.38.0 and is
  already present verbatim in v0.37.0's copy of the file, so it cannot explain a count that only
  rose between those two versions.) `scripts/log.sh` is the one file here with **real** `eval` calls
  on validated input (`eval "$name=$value"`, `eval "$_assign"`), not just the word in a comment --
  the strongest literal candidate for why it, specifically, keeps matching even after #859's
  reword, but this is still a guess, not a confirmed trigger.

  **#864's actual fix** (same issue, second lane, no portal access either): removed both real
  `eval` calls from `scripts/log.sh`'s config-flatten cache loader. Rather than keep `%q` as
  the on-disk format and hand-decode it without `eval` (the first version of this fix, dropped
  mid-review as a fragile byte-by-byte bash loop for no gain over `eval` -- this cache's
  publisher and loader are both owned by this same file, so there was no reason to keep %q's
  shape at all), the format changed to a trivial one this file fully controls: one `NAME` TAB
  `VALUE` record per line, escaping only backslash/newline/tab, decoded with a single
  `printf -v NAME '%b' VALUE` call -- a pure byte-level format directive, never a re-parse of
  the text as shell source. The cache's on-disk path was bumped
  (`remember-config-cache-v2-...`) so an older build's `%q`-based cache is simply never opened.
  Renamed `safe_eval` (in `scripts/log.sh` and every caller) to `assign_kv`, since the old
  name's own text contained the substring `eval` regardless of what its body called. Reworded
  `CHANGELOG.md`'s v0.38.0 entry to drop the literal `curl`/`wget`/`eval "$(...)"` text. After
  this fix, `grep -rniE 'eval|curl|wget'` finds nothing in `pipeline/shell.py`,
  `scripts/log.sh`, or the `CHANGELOG.md` text the slim `release` branch actually ships (the
  latest released section only -- `build_release_tree.py` trims the rest). Whether this
  reaches 0 `RUNTIME_FETCH_EXEC` findings, rather than a lower but nonzero count, is
  unconfirmed without the next portal scan: the matcher's exact mechanism (literal `eval`
  token? command substitution shape? something else?) was never confirmed by either #859's or
  this lane's source-only analysis.

  **Still needs a human with portal access**: expand the "Contains a download-and-run command" row
  under Versions → v0.38.0 (`e3cfd5b`) → Directory policy, and record the file(s) and line(s) shown
  there; update this entry once that is known. Until then, do not spend more effort guessing or
  rewording comments for this row -- #859 already tried that once and the count went up, not down.
  It is a warning, and the portal's own text says "Where it only appears in documentation, nothing
  needs to change".

  **#866** added an automated, REVIEW-only signal for the two shapes #864/#875 actually learned
  to watch for -- `eval` fed by a command substitution (`eval "$(...)"`) and a downloader piped
  straight into a shell (`curl ... | sh`) -- across every shipped text file, not just
  hooks/scripts. This is our own heuristic, not a reimplementation of the portal's matcher (still
  unconfirmed, per the paragraph above): it exists so a REVIEW line names the shape before the
  next portal scan does, not to predict what the portal will find.

  **Observed, 2026-10-02 (#872):** the portal's "Contains a download-and-run command" row **names
  files, not lines** -- on v0.38.0 (`e3cfd5b`) it named `CHANGELOG.md`, `pipeline/shell.py` and
  `scripts/log.sh`, with no line number for any of the three, and all three were false positives
  (#864's closing comment). So a file named in this row is not itself evidence of a real
  download-and-run shape; the file still has to be read to tell.
- **Unrecognized field in `plugin.json`** (warning, 4 findings, new on v0.38.0). Portal text: "If
  you expected the field to do something, check its spelling against the plugins reference.
  Otherwise it can stay." *Inferred, not yet confirmed from the expanded row:* the four are
  `documentationUrl`, `supportUrl`, `privacyPolicyUrl` and `termsOfServiceUrl`, the only top-level
  keys v0.38.0 added to `plugin.json` (#859, #861). That contradicts the code.claude.com plugin
  manifest reference, which says the directory reads exactly these fields for the listing (see
  "Listing details" below). We keep them: the warning itself says they can stay, and the
  reference says they feed the listing. The question is with the directory team.
  **Observed, 2026-10-02 (#872):** the expanded row settles this. For each of
  `documentationUrl`, `privacyPolicyUrl`, `supportUrl` and `termsOfServiceUrl` the portal now
  says "The plugin directory reads '<field>' for the listing; Claude Code itself ignores it at
  load time. No action needed." -- the four findings above are these four fields, confirmed, not
  just inferred, and the right action is still to keep them.
- **`ICON_MISSING`**: the portal accepts a square PNG **or JPEG**, 512 to 2048 px, under 2 MB,
  through `icon` in `plugin.json` (SVG and WebP are not accepted). Keep it inside the plugin
  folder and outside any denied path: an icon under `docs/` vanishes from `release`. **Observed,
  2026-10-02 (#872): the listing icon is set only once.** The exact remedy text: "That file may
  become the listing icon only once: the first time the plugin is saved or submitted in the
  developer portal. Adding or changing it later does not change the icon." remember was saved
  before it shipped an icon, and its portal **Details** page shows the icon as "Set by an
  Anthropic reviewer" (Approved). Shipping one now would only clear the `ICON_MISSING` warning;
  it would not change the listing icon. **The lesson for a new plugin: ship the icon before the
  first portal submission** (see #865). For another repository: put the icon in the plugin
  folder **before** the first save or submit.
- **`USES_HOOKS`** is information only and stays for any plugin that ships hooks.

### For another plugin repository, in addition to the reuse steps below

1. Read your own **Versions** tab first: the full-tree scan of your latest commit already lists
   every rule your plugin trips, before you build anything. A plugin never submitted has no
   Versions tab: use **Submit new → Plugin bundle → Validate** in the portal for the same report.
2. Grep every shipped skill, command and agent for `allowed-tools`. A bare `Bash`, `Bash(*)`, or
   a wildcard after a shell, interpreter, package manager or runner, or `curl` is a hold. A
   specific command (`Bash(git status:*)`) or a named `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` script is not.
   `check_release_tree.py` checks a space-delimited `allowed-tools` string the same as a
   comma-delimited one (#866, trap.d/859); a `..`-escaped path past `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` or a
   wrapper command (`env bash ...`, `sudo curl ...`) in front of an otherwise-scoped entry is
   **not yet** covered -- read it by hand until that lands.
3. Make sure fake credentials live only in denied paths (`tests/`).
4. Put the icon in the plugin folder before the first save or submission (see `ICON_MISSING`).
5. Disclose in README.md everything the plugin runs, sends and stores; expect that disclosure to
   raise warnings, and leave it in.
6. If the plugin itself was ever flagged, a clean, **Approved** version still needs the directory
   team: it waits for them however clean it is (observed on v0.38.0, see "Reading a scan").
   Contact them as soon as the first clean version is Approved, with the before and after
   numbers (ours: policy holds 1 to 0, security scan passed, status Approved).

## Listing details: what comes from where

Sourced on 2026-10-02.

- **The listing fields in `plugin.json`.** Per the code.claude.com plugin manifest reference, the
  directory reads `icon`, `documentationUrl`, `supportUrl`, `privacyPolicyUrl` and
  `termsOfServiceUrl` from `plugin.json`, and Claude Code itself ignores them. The four URLs must
  be `https`. `claude plugin validate` accepts them without a warning only from 2.1.281, hence the
  workflow's pin. #859 added the four URLs to our `plugin.json`, shipped in v0.38.0. On that
  version's scan the portal raised "Unrecognized field in plugin.json" (4 findings), almost
  certainly these four (*inferred*; see the rule above). We keep them.
- **Name and short description.** From claude.com, "Manage your listing after publishing": "A
  plugin listing's name and short description come from plugin.json and the README of the version
  that's live. To change them, edit those files and publish a new version… If an Anthropic
  reviewer edited either field during review, the listing keeps the reviewer's text." The
  **Settings** tab changes the surfaces, the contact email and the "collects or transmits user
  data" answer.
- **Observed for remember:** the **Details** page showed Short description "No value" and
  Keywords "No value", although `plugin.json` has carried `description` and `keywords` since
  March, before the May 7 submission and in the live v0.29.1. So the portal does not fill
  Keywords from `plugin.json`'s `keywords`, at least for this listing; why is unresolved, and the
  question is with the directory team. Homepage, Repository and License were filled.
- **"This plugin collects or transmits user data"** (Settings). The portal's hint names remote MCP
  servers and HTTP hooks. remember switched it on, pointing at [privacy.md](privacy.md), because it
  sends conversation text to the user's own `claude -p` / codex; that is our judgement, not a rule.
  Whatever you choose, README.md has to describe what the plugin sends and where: the security
  scan holds behaviour the README does not disclose.

### Contacting Anthropic about a plugin

Per claude.com, "Track your directory submission": open the plugin's menu in the portal and choose
**Get help** or **Contact Anthropic**, or email `directory@anthropic.com` ("replies can be
delayed"). Include the listing name, the organisation and the status the portal shows. The
portal's **Contact Anthropic** opens a mail to `directory@anthropic.com` with the subject "Plugin
submission".

For remember, the maintainer sent that mail on 2026-10-02, after the v0.38.0 scan, asking the
directory team to clear the plugin-level hold. No reply had arrived as of writing.

## Reusing this in another plugin repository

claude-jit-context and claude-supertool hit the same directory holds and plan to reuse this. Not
everything repository-specific lives in `.github/release-branch.json`:

- `build_release_tree.py` reads `repo`, `default_branch`, `deny`, `changelog`, `rewrite_links` and
  the optional `link_ref` from it; `check_release_tree.py` reads only `budget`. In `budget`,
  `max_file_bytes` and `max_files` are the directory's rules, but `max_total_bytes` (3 MiB) is this
  repository's own ceiling, not a directory rule: set your own.
- `smoke_release_tree.py` reads its hook list from `hooks/hooks.json`. The env-var names it hands
  the hooks for the fake `claude`/`codex` binaries, the prefixes it drops from the smoke
  environment, and the binaries it fakes all come from `.github/release-branch.json`'s `smoke`
  block (`bin_env_vars`, `drop_env_prefixes`, `fake_bins`) -- edit that block, not the script
  (#866). `hook-errors.log` is still read by name, not from config.
- `release-branch.yml` reads the pinned `claude` CLI version from `.github/release-branch.json`'s
  `cli_version`, not from a workflow env entry -- edit that, and keep it at 2.1.281 or later (the
  floor is documented next to it in `_cli_version_why`) (#866).
- Rewritten links point at the head of the default branch (or `link_ref`), not at the tag, so a
  released README's links into removed paths can drift from the version that shipped.

To adopt it:

1. Copy `.github/scripts/{build,check,smoke}_release_tree.py`, `.github/release-branch.json` and
   `.github/workflows/release-branch.yml`, and adapt the points above.
2. Rewrite the deny-list from that repository's own tree. Check every candidate against what the
   plugin loads at runtime (hooks, scripts they call, skills, commands, manifests) before denying
   it, and keep `LICENSE` and `README.md`: the directory blocks without them.
3. Build from the latest tag and run the check and the smoke test locally (section above). Use
   the `REVIEW` lines as a starting list for the README disclosure, then compare with what the
   portal actually flags.
4. Port the tests (`tests/test_release_branch_*_851.py`) and adjust their fixtures.
5. Make sure `github-actions[bot]` can push `release` (no ruleset or branch protection blocking
   it), never make `release` the default branch, and treat push rights on `v*` tags as publish
   rights: whoever can push such a tag publishes to the directory.
6. Push a tag, confirm `release` exists, then do the portal steps in "Switching the listing to
   `release`" above.

Known limits of the shared scripts: the CHANGELOG cut assumes Keep a Changelog `## [x.y.z]`
headings; the smoke test builds payloads only for the common hook events; and the launcher,
credential and image-reference checks are pattern-based, so a reviewer may still see something
they miss.
