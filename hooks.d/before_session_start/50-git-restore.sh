# 50-git-restore.sh — Fast-forward the memory store from its backup remote
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   The mirror of after_save/50-git-backup.sh. That hook pushes; nothing ever
#   read back, so a store used from two machines drifts and the second machine
#   reads stale memory, commits on top of it, and from then on can never push
#   at all (#253).
#
#   Runs on the before_session_start dispatch — before session-start-hook.sh
#   injects recent.md / archive.md into context, which is the only ordering
#   where a restore can affect the session it runs in.
#
#   FAST-FORWARD ONLY. Never merges, never rebases, never resets, never
#   checks out, never stashes. A diverged store is REFUSED and reported,
#   because recent.md and archive.md are rewritten wholesale by consolidation
#   rather than appended, so a conflict there is real and a wrong automatic
#   resolution corrupts memory silently.
#
#   OFF BY DEFAULT (git_restore.enabled). Nothing changes for existing
#   installs until someone asks for it.
#
# NO NETWORK ON THE CRITICAL PATH
#   This hook runs in front of the user's first prompt, and #227 was a plugin
#   that put ~8.7s there. Measured on a warm connection with nothing to
#   download, `git fetch` against GitHub costs ~1.7s; against an unreachable
#   remote it costs whatever the timeout is. That is not a price to pay before
#   every prompt, so the two halves are split by whether they touch the wire:
#
#     * the FAST-FORWARD is synchronous and purely local — it reads the
#       remote-tracking refs an EARLIER session already fetched. Measured
#       ~30ms per git invocation and ~40ms for the merge itself.
#     * the FETCH is detached and its result lands NEXT session. A restore
#       that arrives one session late is still a restore; a session start
#       that hangs on a credential prompt is a user leaving.
#
#   The detach costs one fork (measured 0.24ms here). It is not folded into
#   the backup hook's existing background subshell, which would cost zero
#   forks, for two reasons: #253's reporter was promised in writing that
#   `fetch`, `pull`, `merge` and `rebase` will never appear in that file, and
#   there is a test enforcing it; and a restore that only runs after a save
#   never runs at all in a read-only session, which is exactly the session
#   that most needs fresh memory.
#
# RUNTIME ENV (provided by session-start-hook.sh via dispatch)
#   PROJECT_DIR, PIPELINE_DIR, REMEMBER_DIR, REMEMBER_PROJECT

# ── Cheap guards FIRST, before sourcing anything ─────────────────────────────
# Sourcing log.sh loads and parses the merged config. Most installs are legacy
# mode (memory inside the project) and can never activate this hook, so they
# must not pay for it: `${VAR%/*}` is a shell expansion, not a `dirname` fork,
# and the two tests below cost zero subprocesses.

# #519: normalize before the parameter-expansion split -- REMEMBER_DIR
# arrives backslash-separated on msys/cygwin (resolve-paths.sh's own
# _remember_normalize_win_path), and both `%/*` and `##*/` only ever
# recognise '/' as the boundary, so without this REPO_ROOT stays equal to
# the whole (unsplit) REMEMBER_DIR. That does not fail loudly: the later
# `git -C "$REPO_ROOT" rev-parse --show-toplevel` walks up from the wrong
# (child) directory, finds the TRUE repo root one level up, the two no
# longer match, and the "not toplevel" refusal a few lines down fires
# unconditionally -- so on an affected Windows install with
# git_restore.enabled=true, the whole restore silently never fires, for
# every REMEMBER_DIR, legacy or external, with no error surfaced anywhere.
#
# This is the identical gate `_remember_forward_slash`
# (scripts/resolve-paths.sh, #517) applies, duplicated inline rather than
# calling that function directly: session-start-hook.sh's dispatch() execs
# this file as its own process (not sourced), so a function defined by
# resolve-paths.sh in the PARENT process is not in scope here, and this
# file deliberately does not source resolve-paths.sh itself to keep the
# "cheap guards first" cost promise two lines above -- sourcing it would
# make even a legacy-mode install (the majority, which exits right below
# and can never activate this hook) pay for a config resolution it will
# never use.
#
# PROJECT_DIR is normalized here too (self-review finding), not just
# REMEMBER_DIR: _remember_normalize_win_path rewrites PROJECT_DIR to
# BACKSLASH form on msys/cygwin (scripts/resolve-paths.sh, drive-letter
# branch), the opposite direction from this normalization -- so comparing
# the now-forward-slashed REPO_ROOT against a still-backslash PROJECT_DIR
# would make the legacy-mode short-circuit below never match on a genuine
# legacy install, defeating the exact "cheap guards first" cost promise
# this normalization exists to protect. scripts/doctor.sh:141 and
# scripts/lib-case-divergence.sh:162 normalize both sides of this identical
# REMEMBER_DIR-vs-PROJECT_DIR comparison for the same reason.

# ── Cheap gate BEFORE sourcing anything (#663, part of #660) ─────────────────
# session-start-hook.sh's dispatch() runs this file as a CHILD of a process
# that already sourced log.sh -- which already ran the full three-layer
# config merge (lib-memory-dir.sh: mktemp, jq -s across up to three files)
# and log.sh's own one-pass flatten (another jq call) -- and exported the
# result as REMEMBER_CONFIG. `source log.sh` below is unconditional, so this
# child redid the ENTIRE merge from scratch, every time, before ever reading
# whether the hook is even switched on: because `_LIB_MEMORY_DIR_LOADED` is
# not (and cannot safely be, see the comment on that guard elsewhere in this
# codebase) exported to the child, sourcing lib-memory-dir.sh here re-runs
# unconditionally rather than skipping. #253's default is OFF, so this is
# every dispatch of this hook, on every install that has never touched
# git_restore, paying for a merge whose answer is never used.
#
# The fix is the one the brief names as cheapest: read the flag straight out
# of the ALREADY-MERGED file the parent exported, with one jq (or python)
# call, and only pay for the full chain (which this file still needs for the
# actual restore, and for config()'s other keys below) when that flag says
# yes. If REMEMBER_CONFIG is not there, is not readable, or neither jq nor
# python is available to read it, this must not guess "disabled" -- it falls
# through to the unconditional `source log.sh` + config() gate below
# unchanged, so a install lacking jq/REMEMBER_CONFIG never silently loses a
# restore it asked for. This is strictly an optimization: every path below
# still re-checks the flag through config() before doing anything else.
