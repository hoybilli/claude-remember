"""Check a built release tree against the Anthropic directory's pre-submission
checklist (https://claude.com/docs/plugins/pre-submission-checklist), with the
plugin folder = the root of TREE (#851).

Exit 1 and one `FAIL path: reason` line per offender -- every offender, not the
first -- for every row that can be decided mechanically:

Rows that block or stop validation
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` present and valid JSON; `name` lowercase letters,
    digits and hyphens, 64 characters at most; `description`, `author`, `version` set
  - README.md of at least 40 words, fenced code blocks not counted
  - a LICENSE/LICENCE/COPYING file at the root, or `license` in plugin.json
  - no `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `__MACOSX`
  - names valid on Windows and macOS: no `<>:"|?*` or control characters, no
    trailing dot or space, no device name (con, prn, aux, nul, com1-9, lpt1-9,
    with any extension), no two paths that differ only by case
  - no symlink, no `.git` file or directory (a submodule), no Git LFS pointer
  - no `.gitattributes` setting export-ignore, export-subst or filter
  - every file under 5 MiB
  - every hook script (the HOOK_SCRIPT_NAMES and any .sh a hooks.json command
    names) at most HOOK_SCRIPT_MAX_BYTES, 120 KiB: the scanner stops following
    a hook script past 128 KiB (COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED, #900)
  - hooks/hooks.json: valid JSON, a top-level `hooks` object, known events and
    hook types only, not also named by plugin.json's `hooks`; every command spells
    each path from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, with no other variable, no `$(...)` or
    backticks and no `python -c`
  - YAML front matter with a non-empty text `description` in skills/*/SKILL.md,
    commands/*.md and agents/*.md
  - that same front matter's `allowed-tools` never grants unrestricted shell: bare
    `Bash`, `Bash(*)`, `Bash(:*)`, or `Bash(<command>:*)` / `Bash(<command> *)`
    where the command is a shell (bash, sh, zsh, dash, ksh, fish, pwsh, powershell,
    env), an interpreter (python, node, ruby, perl, ...), a package manager or
    runner (npm, npx, pip, uv, cargo, ...) or a downloader (curl, wget) and no
    plugin script is named -- the full list is _UNSCOPED_COMMANDS below; a
    relative path or a wildcard in a path is held too. A specific command
    (`Bash(git status:*)`) or a named `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...` script passes
  - nothing shaped like a real credential (Anthropic, GitHub, AWS, Slack, Google,
    GitLab keys, private key blocks)

Rows a reviewer holds on
  - every non-image, non-font file under 256 KiB; at most 512 files; only text
    (SVG included), PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP and fonts -- decided by the bytes, not the
    extension; plus this repository's own total-size budget
  - a bundled image is not referenced from commands/, hooks/ or scripts/, and its
    path is not written in backticks or a code block
  - no launcher (npx, bunx, uvx, pipx run, uv run, pnpm dlx, yarn dlx) or package
    install at command position in a hook command or a hooks/, hooks.d/, scripts/ file
  - no root package.json together with a lockfile; no .npmrc, bunfig.toml, uv.toml

Reported, never failed: `REVIEW` lines for code that reads a credential from the
environment or a config file ("uses a credential from the user's machine"), for
`eval` fed by a command substitution or a bare/embedded variable expansion, and
for a downloader (`curl`/`wget`) piped straight into a shell. Each is a
reviewer's judgement call about one shape, not a hard rule -- a plugin's own
installer script can legitimately look like either
of the last two (#866).
