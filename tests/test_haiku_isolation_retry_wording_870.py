"""#870, claim 3: the un-isolated-retry warning always blames the rejected
--setting-sources flag, even when the retry then fails with the SAME
authentication error -- proving isolation was never the cause. The daily log
excerpt in the issue showed this exact pair, repeated on every save for ten
days: "this CLI rejected --setting-sources (Failed to authenticate: ...)"
followed immediately by the retry failing with the identical auth error,
and nothing ever said isolation was innocent or pointed at the real fix
(REMEMBER_OAUTH_TOKEN / `claude setup-token`, #129/#131).

A must-fire / must-not-fire pair: the retry failing with the SAME auth
marker must print the correction; the retry failing with an unrelated
reason (so the correction would be a non-sequitur) must not.
