"""#738 — per_session mode's write-handoff pointer is a per-PROJECT file,
not a per-SESSION one, so the last session to start `SessionStart` owns it.

`handoff_mode: "per_session"` gives each session its own target,
`remember.<session_id>.md` — but until this fix, `session-start-hook.sh`
published that target to exactly ONE file, `tmp/handoff-path`, every time
ANY session started. `write-handoff.sh` then read that one shared file with
no idea which session was actually calling it. Sequence that breaks it:

  1. Session A starts (per_session mode) -> tmp/handoff-path says
     remember.A.md
  2. Session B starts -> tmp/handoff-path is OVERWRITTEN to say
     remember.B.md
  3. Session A runs /remember -> write-handoff.sh reads the (now stale)
     shared pointer and writes into remember.B.md, not remember.A.md

The defect class: a value that is per-SESSION (the resolved handoff path)
was carried over a channel that is per-PROJECT (one file, last writer
wins) — the pointer became the shared, clobberable resource, not the file
it names. The fix threads `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (a live env var Claude
Code sets for the Bash tool, not a value the model reads/asserts) through
to write-handoff.sh, which prefers a SESSION-KEYED hint file
(`tmp/handoff-path.<id>`) over the shared one whenever it exists.

Three properties, mirroring test_handoff_per_session_363.py's own shape:
  - two sessions started in sequence (A then B) do not make A's own write
    land in B's file merely because B started more recently
  - positive control: default/single mode is unaffected -- both sessions'
    writes still land in the one shared remember.md
  - positive control: the correct session's file DOES get written (not
    merely "not the wrong one" -- a broken pointer that refused everything
    would also make the negative assertion pass for the wrong reason)
