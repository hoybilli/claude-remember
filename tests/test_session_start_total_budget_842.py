"""thresholds.session_start_max_bytes: a total SessionStart budget (#842).

Claude Code (observed on 2.1.278) persists hook stdout longer than roughly
10,000 characters to a file and hands the model only a short preview plus the
file's path. An ordinary SessionStart on a healthy store (six small files,
each individually well under thresholds.memory_inject_max_bytes) can still
sum past that line -- the per-file cap cannot help, because it has no notion
of a TOTAL across files. This is request 1 of #842: fill handoff -> now ->
recent -> today -> archive in that priority order, and list by name and size
whatever does not fit, exactly like the source=compact path already does for
its own deferred files.

TDD bar for every "must not fit" assertion here: would it still pass if the
budget were simply never applied? Paired with a positive control proving the
same section IS injected when the budget is not tight.
