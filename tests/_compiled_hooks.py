"""Tell a compiled hook from its source (#900).

The `hook tests (compiled)` CI leg (.github/workflows/tests.yml) runs
`.github/scripts/compile_hooks.py --apply` on a fresh checkout, which
overwrites each of the four hooks.json-registered scripts IN PLACE with its
compiled form: libraries inlined, whole-line comments stripped, unreached
functions dropped. Every behavioural test then exercises the compiled hook,
which is the point of that leg.

A handful of tests are not behavioural: they pin facts about a hook's SOURCE
TEXT -- a comment's wording (#637), how many comment lines keep an em-dash
(#367), that the hook's own code no longer spells a subshell (#511), which
source lines carry a letter range and where (#695). A compiled hook is a
build product, not that source: its comments are gone by design and its
lines carry inlined library code. Those tests skip a compiled hook, saying
so, rather than assert facts about the wrong file -- the plain `pytest` job
runs them against the real source on every OS and interpreter, so nothing
they check goes unchecked.

The compiler writes COMPILED_MARKER as the line right after the shebang;
.github/scripts/compile_hooks.py holds the same string, and
tests/test_compile_hooks_900.py pins that a compiled hook carries it and a
source hook does not.
