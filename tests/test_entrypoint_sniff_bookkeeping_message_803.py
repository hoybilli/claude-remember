"""#803: `_transcript_is_pluginless_sdk()`'s message-field skip (#745) can mask
the exact bug it exists to prevent.

The function skips any line carrying a top-level `"message"` key outright, on the
theory that such a line is "real dialogue, never a bookkeeping record" (the code's
own comment). That theory is wrong for a bookkeeping record that carries a
`"message"` key of its own as a plain STRING (an error/status field on, say, a
`queue-operation` record) rather than the nested `{role, content}` OBJECT real
dialogue always uses. If that same line also carries the `"entrypoint"` field this
whole function exists to find, the substring-only skip discards it unseen -- the
pluginless-SDK exclusion silently never fires, and the false notice / force-save
#745 exists to fix reappears for that transcript.

Fixed by discriminating on the message field's own JSON *shape*, not just its
presence: `_stdin_json_string` only succeeds when a value opens with a quote, so it
fails on the object shape and succeeds on the string shape -- an existing helper
already in the file, no new JSON-parsing machinery needed.

Positive control: a bookkeeping-shaped line (string "message", sdk- "entrypoint")
must still be recognized as pluginless-SDK. Negative control, paired per this
repo's own convention: a genuine dialogue line (object "message") that happens to
mention the literal `"entrypoint":"sdk-` substring in its own conversational text
must still be skipped -- proving the fix does not simply stop skipping altogether.
