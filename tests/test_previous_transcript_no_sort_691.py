"""#691: `previous_transcript()` (and its no-CURRENT_SESSION_ID sibling at
scripts/session-start-hook.sh's second `PREV_JSONL=` call site) sorted every
`.jsonl` in SESSIONS_DIR with `ls -t` on every session start, only to read
one line and throw the sort of everything else away. Per the issue's own
measured table (windows-latest, the #660 diagnostic): 0.104s at 500
transcripts, 0.41s at 2000 -- the only cost in the hook that grows with how
long a project has been used.

Fixed by a single pass over the glob using bash's own `-nt` test operator (a
builtin, not a fork) to track the newest (and, for the no-id fallback,
second-newest) transcript by mtime -- no `ls`, no `sort`, no per-file `stat`
fork, regardless of how many transcripts exist.

This extracts the real functions out of scripts/session-start-hook.sh (the
same approach test_dirname_without_a_fork_660.py uses for
_remember_memory_paths) rather than running the whole hook, so the fixture
can cheaply reach a "realistic count" (the issue's own words, since the
existing benchmark fixtures never populate more than one transcript) and
exercise both call sites -- with and without CURRENT_SESSION_ID -- directly.
