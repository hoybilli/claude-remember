"""#864 -- the Anthropic directory's scan flags `eval "..."` in a shipped file as
RUNTIME_FETCH_EXEC ("Contains a download-and-run command"), even though the only
things being `eval`'d here were the two lines inside the old
`_remember_cfg_flatten_cache_load` (scripts/log.sh) that turned a `%q`-quoted
word back into a plain shell value.

Course correction mid-fix (scheduler review): the first version of this fix kept
`%q` as the on-disk format and replaced `eval` with a hand-written, byte-by-byte
decoder that inverted %q's own escaping rules -- correct, but a fragile
character-by-character bash loop on a hot path, and more code than the `eval`
it replaced. Since this cache's publisher and loader are both owned by this
same file, there is no reason to keep %q's shape at all: the format was
changed to a trivial one instead -- one `NAME` TAB `VALUE` record per line,
where VALUE escapes only three bytes (backslash, newline, tab) -- decoded with
a single `printf -v NAME '%b' VALUE` call. `%b` is a pure byte-level format
directive, never a re-parse of VALUE as shell source, so there is no
metacharacter here that ever needed defusing for SAFETY; the whitelist in
`_remember_cfg_flatten_cache_valid_value` exists for CORRECTNESS (rejecting an
escape %b would read differently from how this file's own encoder meant it,
such as `\\c`, `\\xHH` or octal). The cache's on-disk path itself was bumped
(`remember-config-cache-v2-...`) so a cache an older build wrote in the old
%q-based format is simply never opened, rather than needing a migration path.

These tests pin the new encode/decode pair
(`_remember_cfg_flatten_q_encode` / `_remember_cfg_flatten_q_decode`) for every
awkward value named in review: empty, `~`, `a:~`, spaces, quotes, `;|&`,
newlines, tabs, backslashes and non-ASCII -- and the two real call sites,
the REMEMBER_DIR identity line and the full publish/load round trip.
