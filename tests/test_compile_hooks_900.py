"""Hook self-containment, compiled at build time (#900).

The Anthropic plugin directory's release-preview validator inspects only
the command a `hooks/hooks.json` entry names; it never follows a
`source`/`.` statement into a second file, so each of the four
hooks.json-registered scripts was held as COMMAND_SCRIPT_NOT_FOLLOWED
(jit-context's own write-up, #900) for sourcing shared library code.
build_release_tree.py now inlines each one's own source chain at build
time (.github/scripts/compile_hooks.py) before it ever reaches
check_release_tree.py's FAIL guard (_check_hook_still_sources).

Every negative here is paired with a positive: a comment stripper that
drops nothing would still pass every "must preserve" assertion below, so
each "must be removed" case sits next to a "must survive" one, and the
synthetic end-to-end test below pins the one claim a unit test cannot:
that sourcing N files and inlining the same N files, include-guard
deduped, produce byte-identical *behaviour* when actually run.
